# v20 published the current-control pointer and the refresh protocol; v21 adds
# action-scoped ``control.permissions`` and the ``review_publishable`` state;
# v22 publishes the compact ``shipgate.agent_control/v1`` control envelope;
# v23 spells every emitted command for the invocation that produced it and adds
# the ``executable``/``args`` pair to ``next_actions[]``.
#
# v23 carries a version because ``NextAction`` is published with
# ``extra="forbid"``: two new properties are *not* additive for a consumer
# validating against the v22 shape, even though they are optional. They are
# omitted rather than emitted as ``null``, so an action that cannot carry an
# argv is unchanged on the wire.
#
# v24 rolls the control envelope across the setup commands (#323): ``detect``,
# ``init``, and ``doctor`` publish ``shipgate.agent_control/v1`` under
# ``decision_source: "setup"``, with new ``operation`` values and closed
# per-source ``decision`` vocabularies.
#
# ``MINIMUM_CONTROL_CONTRACT_VERSION`` stays at 21, and this time the argument is
# about the type rather than about which code paths run. The ``AgentControl``
# union is byte-identical to v21: a typed ``edit`` action was added and then
# removed, because that union is embedded by six durable published schemas —
# verifier, agent-handoff, preflight, agent-result, agent-boundary-result, and
# verify-run — so widening it widened all six under unchanged identifiers, and
# five of those artifacts carry no ``contract_version`` for a consumer holding a
# stored payload to disambiguate with.
#
# What v24 does widen is ``shipgate.agent_control/v1`` itself, which is emitted
# on stdout and never written as an artifact. There are no stored envelopes to
# disambiguate, and its new operations cannot appear in any artifact a v21
# consumer holds.
#
# v25 adds one route to that same envelope: ``next_action.kind:
# confirm_declarations`` on ``verify``'s coding-agent route, carrying the
# declaration questions this run can have an agent draft and the ones it
# cannot, each tagged ``authorable_by`` (#410 §D). The underlying
# ``AgentControl`` is again byte-identical — the control holds the step as the
# ``repair`` command it truthfully is, and the envelope publishes the richer
# form, exactly as ``edit`` does for setup — so
# ``MINIMUM_CONTROL_CONTRACT_VERSION`` stays at 21 for the third time and for
# the same reason.
#
# v27 finishes the v24 rollout on the stream v24 left out. ``detect``, ``init``
# and ``doctor`` publish ``shipgate.agent_control/v1`` on **every** agent-mode
# error line, not only the two ``doctor`` routes that already carried one — so
# whether an envelope-only caller can route no longer depends on which setup
# command failed and on which of its failures. Nothing is removed:
# ``next_action`` and ``next_actions[]`` are unchanged on those lines. The one
# stated exception is the shared ``--workspace`` refusal, which fires before a
# workspace exists and therefore has no setup subject to compute an identity
# against.
#
# ``AgentControl`` and ``shipgate.agent_control/v1`` are both byte-identical to
# v26 — the same envelope reaches one more place — so
# ``MINIMUM_CONTROL_CONTRACT_VERSION`` stays at 21 for the fourth time.
#
# v28 publishes the capability delta as a standalone, versioned attestation
# (#470). ``verify`` writes
# ``agents-shipgate-reports/capability-delta-attestation.json`` — an in-toto
# Statement whose predicate carries the frozen
# ``shipgate.capability_payload/v1`` delta — and the contract now names the
# predicate type, the two schema versions and the artifact, so a consumer can
# discover the format without reading our source. The payload schema was frozen
# in v27's cycle but deliberately left unregistered while nothing emitted it;
# this is the increment that ships both halves together.
#
# Additive on the agent side: ``AgentControl`` and
# ``shipgate.agent_control/v1`` are byte-identical to v27, so
# ``MINIMUM_CONTROL_CONTRACT_VERSION`` stays at 21 for the fifth time. The
# attestation gates nothing — ``release_decision.decision`` remains the only
# release gate — and is absent, with a note on the run, whenever the evaluated
# subject is a worktree snapshot rather than a committed tree.
#
# v29 publishes action-declaration review as a first-class reviewer surface
# (#428). The contract advertises report 0.43, packet 0.18, and verifier 0.16
# so consumers can discover the declaration comparison without guessing from
# prose. Runtime v28 is already the capability-delta contract;
# reusing that number here would give one version two incompatible meanings.
#
# The operational control shapes remain byte-identical to v28, so
# ``MINIMUM_CONTROL_CONTRACT_VERSION`` stays at 21 for the sixth time.
# v30 publishes a separately bound human review question (#536). No shared
# control type or historical grammar changes; the control floor stays at 21.
# v31 advertises the separate, host-neutral decision evaluator. It does not
# add a CLI command, widen operational control or create a trust context.
# v32 adds conditional instruction-edit routing (verifier 0.17/handoff v9),
# preflight 0.5 and host inventories/baselines/drift 0.3. Old readers retain
# their conservative boundary; structural comparison never grants authority.
# v33 routes recognized host-only configuration from discovery to audit,
# without inventing a manifest. The new detect fields are filename evidence
# and incomplete traversal, not grants. Operational control is unchanged.
# v34 advertises host inventories/baselines/drift 0.4: workflow permission
# projections and reusable secret recipients. Operational control is unchanged.
# v35 carries manifest-free advisory host comparison evidence and named check rows.
# v36 freezes the report contract at ``1.0`` (#569). No field is added,
# renamed, retyped or removed: the emitted shape is the one v35 advertised as
# report ``0.43``. The bump exists because what the runtime *promises* about
# that shape changed -- 1.x is additive-only, a breaking change needs 2.0, and
# a deprecation cycle is counted in shipped releases -- and a consumer must be
# able to discover that from ``contract --json`` rather than from prose. The
# operational control shapes remain byte-identical, so
# ``MINIMUM_CONTROL_CONTRACT_VERSION`` stays at 21.
# v37 names the unchanged limits a host comparison compared past (#721).
