        """Bind progress authority to the substrate, on every state.

        The control variant cannot see ``execution``, ``diff_status``, or the
        release decision, so this is the only layer that can tell whether the
        change being published was read at all. Keyed on ``permissions``, not
        on ``state``: an ``agent_action_required`` repair route asserts exactly
        the same thing about the change as a publishable review does.

        ``complete`` is excluded because it is governed by the stricter
        ``can_merge_without_human`` projection above — that is the one state
        where a deterministic *not-applicable* skip legitimately authorizes
        everything without a release decision.
