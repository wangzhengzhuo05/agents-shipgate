"""`shipgate diff` — what this change does to the agent's authority.

The engine already computes this. `audit --host --drift` compares two host
inventories and names every typed grant change; it just required a baseline
someone had committed in advance and reachable from the branch, which is
why the answer was two checkouts and a recorded file away.

This command supplies the other side from Git instead: materialise the base
tree, read it with the same host readers, and hand both inventories to the
same comparator. No manifest, no committed baseline, no verdict — the rows
are the answer, and the release decision stays where it lives (#651).
