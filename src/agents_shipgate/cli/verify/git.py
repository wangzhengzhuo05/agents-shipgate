    Over-matching is deliberate: an unrelated document carrying both keys
    merely costs the adoption wording. ``protected_names`` provides the
    independent canonical-name guard from this same bounded tree listing, so
    callers never need a second unbounded ``ls-tree`` process.

    ``None`` means the answer could not be established — an unreadable tree or
    a tree/candidate beyond the bounds above. Files that are not UTF-8 YAML
    objects are safely skipped because ``load_manifest`` cannot accept them.
    Callers must treat ``None`` as "cannot prove", never as absence.
