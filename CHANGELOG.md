# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Compare past an unchanged partial or experimental surface instead of refusing
  every row (#721, runtime contract 37, verifier schema `0.19`). A comparison
  refused whenever either inventory was incomplete, including for a file the
  change never touched. In the #660 cold start that stopped 11 of 30 public
  repositories: one unresolved skill or one `.vscode/mcp.json` blocked every
  host-config comparison. `diff` and `verify` now compare the rest when the
  limit is a per-source `unsupported` or `parse_failed` issue, or experimental
  coverage, present on both sides and byte-identical by Git object ID. Each such
  limit is named in `host_comparison.unchanged_limits`, in `diff --json` (`0.2`)
  and in the text and PR-comment output. A limit that changed, appears on one
  side only, or is `unreadable` still refuses; symlinks remain #700's decision.
  `check`'s boundary result cannot carry a limit and keeps refusing there.
  `audit --host --save-baseline` still refuses an incomplete inventory.

- Make a URL-based MCP server's query part of its change digest (#723). The
  digest hashed only the redacted URL, which keeps the scheme and host and drops
  everything else. So removing `read_only=true` from a Supabase MCP URL, adding
  `features=` or switching projects produced no row. The #660 cold start found
  the `features` case on a public repository. Published fields are unchanged and
  still carry no path, query or secret. A secret-named query parameter
  contributes only its name, and `env` and `headers` stay out. The path stays out
  too: a webhook-style path is a secret whose rotation must stay quiet, so a
  path-only capability change is still not seen. Servers without a query keep
  their earlier digest. A baseline saved earlier shows each affected URL server
  as `changed` once.

- Resolve documented Claude skill and command frontmatter instead of refusing it
  (#722). An unresolved instruction is a blocking coverage issue, so one such
  file made a repository's whole host inventory partial. Skills now accept
  `when_to_use`, `arguments`, `disallowed-tools`, `effort`, `background`,
  `paths` and `shell`. Commands accept `user-invocable`, `disallowed-tools`,
  `effort`, `arguments`, `name` and `paths`, as the docs say they take the same
  frontmatter as skills. `argument-hint` may use its documented bracket form,
  which YAML reads as a list. A skill without `name` takes its directory name,
  and the default enters the structure digest. Claude booleans accept `yes`,
  `no`, `on`, `off`, `1` and `0`, while Cursor's `alwaysApply` stays exact.
  `effort` and `shell` are checked against their documented values, and
  `description` is still required. Undocumented keys such as `version` and
  `author` are still refused. The #660 results now name the right cause for
  `justinstimatze/winze`: its bracket-form `argument-hint`, not a string
  `allowed-tools`, which was always accepted.

- Add the cold-start harness under `benchmark/cold-start/` (#660). It measures
  whether `shipgate diff`, run from a fresh clone of a frozen population of 30
  public repositories, reaches a correct, covered comparison. Expected changes
  are derived from the files and host documentation, never from the engine.
  Incomparable, unsupported and unclassified cases never count as success.
  `tests/test_cold_start_replay.py` replays every case offline against its
  recorded outcome. The first run, against candidate `8d43106f`, recorded
  17/30 against a bar of 24. Every comparison that ran was correct, and all 11
  failures stopped on a surface the commit did not change (#700, #720–#723).

- Resolve local Claude Code settings layers by the documented precedence
  instead of refusing them. `audit --host --scope local-static` raised a
  blocking `unresolved_precedence` issue whenever two layers existed, so user
  settings plus a project's `.claude/settings.json` — the ordinary developer
  setup — could never save a local baseline. Permission rules, additional
  directories and hooks now merge across layers; a scalar setting keeps the
  highest layer that sets it (managed, project local, shared project, user),
  and the remaining grant's `source` names that layer; a same-named MCP server
  keeps the local-scope entry over `.mcp.json`; and `allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly`
  and `allowManagedHooksOnly` restrict rules and hooks only from managed
  settings. A `defaultMode` of `auto` or `bypassPermissions` in a project file
  is still reported, beside the lower layer's mode, because older clients
  honored it. Disagreeing `sandbox` or `enabledPlugins` values, a layer with no
  documented rank, and Codex and Cursor layers still fail closed; the issue now
  names the key and each layer. The repository scope, which the PR route uses,
  is unchanged (#657).

- Publish a version that reviewed code declares advisory through the ordinary
  release pipeline, with no qualification claim (#648). Each version's channel
  is declared in `.github/release-channels.json`, and a missing or unknown
  entry stops the release before anything is built. `release.yml` calls
  exactly one of `release-verify.yml`, which is unchanged, and the new
  `release-advisory-verify.yml`; one publisher serves both. An advisory release
  publishes the wheel Release Engine Smoke exercised, proven byte-identical to
  the tagged tree's build, with a wheel-scoped SBOM, a provenance record, the
  candidate manifest and a signed `advisory-statement.json`. Staging and
  finalisation refuse a manifest whose channel or asset set is not the declared
  channel's, and the mandatory rehearsal is the declared channel's own file.
  `release_cadence.py` reads each tag's declaration, so an advisory `v*` tag
  never counts as a gate-line release. Policy:
  `docs/release-evidence-policy-decision.md` § Amendment 5.

- Run the FastMCP Context-injection SDK cross-checks on the SDK versions the
  `[mcp]` extra allows. FastMCP was renamed to MCPServer in mcp 2.x and the
  extra requires `mcp>=2.1.1,<3`, but both cross-checks imported only the 1.x
  module, so the eight cases comparing the static reader with the real SDK's
  `find_context_parameter` skipped on every install that satisfies the extra,
  CI included; they still ran, but only against an out-of-range mcp 1.x such as 1.27.2. They now try the 2.x location first and the
  1.x one second, skip only when `mcp` is absent, and fail when an installed
  SDK exposes neither. All eight pass on mcp 2.2.0 and on 1.27.2 (#716).

- Freeze the report contract at `1.0` and publish what that number promises.
  `report_schema_version` moves `0.43` → `1.0` and runtime contract `33` → `34`;
  `minimum_control_contract_version` stays `21`. The shape does not change:
  `docs/report-schema.v1.0.json` and `docs/report-schema.v0.43.json` are
  byte-identical apart from `$id`, `title` and the version constant, so a
  consumer written against `0.43` needs no edit. `1.x` is additive-only, a
  change that cannot be expressed additively needs `2.0`, a deprecation cycle
  counts shipped releases rather than time on unreleased `main`, and every
  published schema URL keeps its bytes. The stable/provisional inventory of
  report fields, CLI, exit-code, Action and control surfaces, the migration
  from the shipped `v0.15.0` contract, and the recorded RC exercise are in
  [`docs/report-1-0-contract.md`](docs/report-1-0-contract.md), checked against
  the runtime by `tests/test_report_1_0_contract.py`.

  Pre-freeze `0.x` reports are no longer accepted as engine *input*.
  `scan --diff-from`, `apply-patches`, `explain-finding`, `findings`, `scenario suggest` and
  `evidence-packet` refuse one by name, with a stable `reason_code` and a
  regeneration route, instead of validating it against a model whose defaults
  would stand in for blocks it never recorded. A report from a newer `1.x`
  minor is read by a projection reader and refused by evidence comparison
  or patch application.
  Nothing is converted and no artifact gains current authority through
  conversion or a restamped digest; every superseded schema stays published, so
  archived reports remain validatable. An incomparable `--diff-from` base still
  withholds the verdict rather than downgrading it — that routing is now keyed
  on the refusal's own reason code instead of on its wording.

  The production `beta` qualification policy's `required_report_schema_version`
  moves to `1.0` with the engine. Issuance of the `pre_1_0` tier is retired:
  `scripts/run_safety_qualification.py` produces no artifact carrying it and
  `--policy-tier pre-1.0` is refused by name. The policy, its thresholds and
  every reader of it remain, and it keeps its historical `0.43` pin so an
  artifact already scored against it is still named and diagnosed correctly.
  No scoring floor moved.

  `docs/distribution-surfaces.md` gains a `report_schema_pin` claim: the five
  surfaces that tell a reader which `report-schema.v<X>.json` to validate
  against are now checked from the registry, in both directions (a pin left
  behind and a pin ahead of the build), instead of by hand-maintained per-file
  lists. `explain-finding` refuses a report whose findings carry no
  `agent_action` rather than explaining a null one, the way `findings` already
  refuses a missing `provenance_kind` (#569).

- Tell a widened permission rule from a narrowed one, and stop rating
  reading files as critical. Host grants are keyed by rule text, so
  replacing `Bash(npm *)` with `Bash(npm test:*)` arrived as one removal
  plus one addition — byte-for-byte the same shape as replacing it with
  `Bash(*)`. Set arithmetic cannot separate those, so drift reported a
  tightening as an expansion, and a reviewer who tightens a rule and gets
  warned for it learns to stop reading the warnings. A new
  `core/permission_lattice.py` decides which of two rules is wider for the
  patterns hosts actually use — whole-tool grants, trailing-star prefixes,
  literals, and the bare `mcp__server__*` spelling — and answers `None`
  for anything else, including character classes and interior stars, where
  a guess would be the same wrong direction in a new place. A narrowing no
  longer contributes to `expansion_signals`; it stays visible in `changes`
  as the removal and addition it is. A widening is now named
  (`permission_widened: <host>:<before> -> <after>`) rather than only
  counted.

  The same lattice sets severity, replacing a model where every wildcard
  allow was `admin`/`critical`. `Read(**)` sat beside `Bash(*)` at the top
  of the table. On a carefully written host config — wildcard reads,
  scoped `Bash` and `Edit`, two deny rules, one MCP server, a
  least-privilege workflow — `audit --host` rated 7 of 10 grants `high` or
  `critical`, three of them `critical`/`admin` for reading files. The same
  config now rates 1 of 10 above `medium`: the MCP server, which is the
  one row there that can reach anything new. Severity follows what the
  grant reaches:
  execution and `*` stay `critical`, network and write are `high`, an
  unrecognised whole-tool grant is `high` because nothing establishes
  otherwise, and reading a workspace the agent already has checked out is
  `low`.

  This narrows a blocking check. `SHIP-HOST-BOUNDARY-PERMISSION-WILDCARD-ALLOW`
  blocked the release on any wildcard allow, so adding `Read(**)` — the
  ordinary configuration for a coding agent — was a `critical` release
  blocker, and a gate that stops a release over reading files is one a team
  turns off. Read-only whole-tool grants now raise
  `SHIP-HOST-BOUNDARY-PERMISSION-ALLOW-EXPANDED` (`require_review`, `high`)
  instead. Nothing else moves: execution, network, write, `*` and unknown
  tools still block, and the check ID is unchanged for them. The gate had
  classified wildcards a second time in `core/host_boundary.py`; both
  readers now share the one lattice, and a test pins that they agree.

  `policies/host-boundary.shipgate.yaml` records why each severity is what
  it is, one `why:` line per rule — nine of the ten sat at `high` or above
  with nothing written down. `tests/test_permission_lattice.py`
  carries twenty widen/narrow/unchanged pairs replayed through the real
  reader for both hosts with a rule vocabulary, and marks the two pairs
  this lattice declines so the boundary moves visibly rather than
  silently. Replayed against pre-fix `main`, 51 of its 78 cases fail
  (#657).

- Lead the Cursor instruction surface with `shipgate diff`. It opened with
  the control envelope, so an agent following it reported "a human must
  review" without naming what changed, while `AGENTS.md` had led with the
  named rows since #651. The generated file now names the row fields, says
  a covered comparison with no rows is a real answer, and repeats that a
  row is a description and never a permission. The committed rule file and
  the copyable snippet in `docs/target-repo-agent-snippets.md` are
  regenerated from the one renderer; both are pinned to it by tests (#662).

- Read `.claude/hooks/hooks.json`. A `SessionStart` command is executable code
  around the agent and was invisible; the document is the same shape as
  `.codex/hooks.json`, which has been read since the Codex adapter landed, so
  only the registry entry was missing. Hook rows now name their event rather
  than rendering as "hook". Found by counting disagreements between the
  adapter registry and an independent census of host paths, now committed at
  `benchmark/cold-start/census.py`: it prints unexplained coverage gaps,
  issue-owned gaps and census bugs on every run, so a path nobody registered
  can no longer look like a change that did nothing (#689).

- Keep a directory at a recognized host configuration path visible as a failed
  input. Host audits, worktree diffs and committed-ref comparisons no longer
  mistake `.mcp.json/` for an absent configuration and report complete coverage.
  Scoped base trees preserve directory kinds even when their contents are not
  selected; ordinary containers remain valid (#613).

- Advisory `diff` and manifest-free PR review materialize boundary paths and
  symlinks from a verified tree instead of copying commit ancestry and writing
  every file. The original sample improved from 25s to 2.7s; residual latency
  remains #698, not a universal two-second promise. Shallow comparisons verify
  that a visible common ancestor does not hide a newer one beyond a graft;
  unresolved ancestry requests a fetch, while HEAD and proven ancestor
  comparisons remain usable. Configured release archives retain their existing
  whole-history validation. Scoped archives preserve links, but the reader
  remains conservative until link-target identity can be bound (#700/#711):
  successful materialization is not complete inventory coverage (#686/#688).

- Read the Cursor rule format Cursor actually writes. `globs:` with nothing
  after it — how Cursor spells a rule that is not glob-scoped — reads as
  YAML null, and the frontmatter type check rejected null for every field.
  That made the canonical `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` an unresolved instruction
  structure, which is a blocking inventory issue, which made the whole
  repository incomparable: `Doist/todoist-mcp` has eleven readable host
  files and two such rules, and `diff` produced no rows for any of them on
  every step of its history. An explicit null is now read as an absent key,
  which is what it means. Wrong types are still wrong, unknown keys are
  still unknown, and a skill with an empty `name` or `description` still
  fails on identity rather than sliding through (#712).

- Manifest-free host PR review now names capability changes in verify, PR comments,
  and check. Interactive check defaults to readable text; agent mode keeps JSON.
  Comparison evidence binds its input refs, excludes stale scan artifacts, and
  never grants application release or merge authority (#684).

- Compare workflow permissions rather than whole-file edits in host diffs.
  Script-only changes no longer appear as permission changes, and an
  existing write grant is not reannounced as a widening. Effective job
  permissions respect explicit overrides; reusable calls that inherit
  secrets name the receiving workflow. Contract v34 and host schema v0.4
  preserve legacy readers without inventing missing recipient evidence
  (#685).

- Read literal TypeScript MCP tool descriptions from both SDK registration
  shapes. Only the options object's own direct description is used; later
  overrides invalidate stale text, and a later explicit literal can restore
  it. Nested parameter descriptions and unsupported member/key expressions
  never supply the tool's documentation. Package and zero-install readers
  share all read/refusal cases, including supported CommonJS inputs (#680).
  TypeScript translation-helper semantics remain deferred in #691.

- Detect shallow checkouts before `diff` scans either side. Print a scoped
  `git fetch --unshallow` recovery (or `fetch-depth: 0` for CI) instead of
  an object-integrity traceback; agent-mode errors carry the same runnable
  next action. Object integrity checks remain unchanged (#683).

- Read Go MCP tool descriptions from struct `Description` fields and
  direct `WithDescription`/`WithToolDescription` options. Later description
  options replace earlier ones, including empty or computed values. Nested calls and partial
  expressions cannot supply the parent tool's description.

  A complete two-string call to a declared `TranslationHelperFunc` parameter
  can supply its literal default. An arbitrary function with key-shaped
  arguments, an unbound helper, or a shadowed/reassigned parameter cannot.
  Go trailing commas and comments are supported. The package reader and
  zero-install detector share regression inputs for these boundaries.
  First increment of #658; source annotation projection remains separate.

- Make every emitted next action lead somewhere, and prove it. Following
  `control.next_action` on a repository with recognized host configuration
  and no manifest went round three commands forever: `verify --preview`
  named `init --write`, `init` refused because a host-only repository needs
  no manifest and named `audit --host`, and `audit --host` named
  `verify --preview` again. The host-audit footer is now conditional — the
  baseline comparison where there is no manifest, `verify` where there is,
  `--drift` once a baseline exists — and it says to record the baseline on
  the base ref, never on the changed checkout, which would accept the change
  instead of comparing it. That footer also emitted its command without
  `--workspace`, so following it ran the next step against the caller's
  current directory rather than the repository just audited; every emitted
  command now carries the workspace it was produced for. A preview that
  evaluated no gate reports `Agents Shipgate verify: not evaluated` instead
  of `failed`, matching the `not_run` its machine fields already carried.
  `tests/test_next_action_chains_terminate.py` walks every entry command on
  two repository shapes and fails on a repeat, a lost workspace, or a step
  this CLI cannot run (#650).

- Split the release into two lines and measure both. The advisory line
  publishes `diff`, `check`, `audit --host`, drift and advisory PR comments
  through the unqualified preview on a 14-day interval; the qualified gate
  line publishes blocking verdicts, receipts and attestations through a `v*`
  tag on evidence only. One engine, two promises, neither waiting on the
  other — the state this ends is a documented workflow that was two months
  out of an outsider's reach because the only channel that could carry it
  was blocked behind bars that exist to justify blocking a merge, which the
  advisory line never does. `scripts/release_cadence.py` now reports both
  from one renderer, counting `v*` for the gate line and `preview-*` for the
  advisory line; the separation is load-bearing, because counting previews
  in the release metric would let the channel that exists *because* the
  release cadence slipped report that cadence as kept. Neither line fails a
  pull request, for the reason already recorded for the release cadence:
  whichever change arrives after an interval lapses is not the one that can
  cut a release. `--fail-when-overdue` now covers both, for an operator or a
  scheduled job. Recorded as Amendment 4 in
  `docs/release-evidence-policy-decision.md`; no gate-line bar moves (#648).

- Compare against the detected base by default in `check`, so a branch's
  committed work is visible without flags. `shipgate check` compared the
  working tree with `HEAD`, so on a branch whose changes were already
  committed it answered `allow` with an empty change set — truthfully
  reporting "nothing is uncommitted" to someone asking "what does this
  branch change". Reaching the real answer took `--base <ref> --head HEAD`,
  a pair the help never suggested and which the CLI rejected unless both
  were given. A flagless run now compares the detected default branch's
  merge base against the working tree, one comparison spanning committed
  and uncommitted work, and `subject.base` names the ref it used. `--base`
  and `--head` are independent; `--base HEAD` keeps the previous
  uncommitted-only comparison. On the default branch the working-tree
  answer is complete and unchanged. Where no base can be detected — no
  remote and no `main` or `master` — the run stops and names `--base`
  rather than reporting a pass it did not establish. The implicit local
  fallback is narrow on purpose: a local `main` is refused while a remote
  exists, because the remote is the authority it might be stale against,
  and used only where the repository has no remote at all. `verify`'s own
  base detection is untouched, and the emitted `verify` command now accepts
  either ref alone so it cannot disagree with the check that emitted it
  (#649).

- Show a reader six commands and speak to them in their own language.
  `--help` listed three of 53 commands while every documented first step —
  `init`, `doctor` — was hidden from the one place a stranger looks; it now
  lists `diff`, `check`, `verify`, `audit`, `init` and `doctor`, and the new
  `--help-all` lists every command, rendered from the same Click command as
  the real help so the two cannot fall out of step. Prominence is a reading
  aid, never a claim about what exists. Reader-facing strings are now
  guarded: `tests/test_reader_vocabulary.py` runs every shipped fixture and
  fails when a headline, summary, `control.reason` or `why` carries engine
  vocabulary. It found two — "the agent's tool binding graph is incomplete"
  and "a complete root-reachable static binding graph is required for
  passed" — which now say what a reader must fix rather than the model it is
  fixed in. Enum values are untouched: `release_decision.decision` is still
  `insufficient_evidence` for the machines that gate on it (#652).

- Add `shipgate diff`: what this change does to the agent's authority, in one
  row per host grant, with no manifest and no committed baseline. The engine
  already decided this — `audit --host --drift` names every typed grant
  change — but it required a baseline recorded in advance and reachable from
  the branch, so the answer was two checkouts and a committed file away. The
  new command supplies the other side from Git: materialise the base tree,
  read it with the same host readers, hand both inventories to the same
  comparator. Rows carry before, after, direction, why it matters and the
  engine's own severity, most severe first, with `⚠` on the changes the
  engine called expansions of authority. A benign change prints one line.
  `--json` emits the same rows. Every field is read from the drift payload,
  so the command cannot disagree with the engine about a change it did not
  decide: `risk` is the engine's severity and `expansion_signals` is the
  engine's word on widening, and a change the engine has not called an
  expansion is reported as `changed` rather than guessed to be a narrowing —
  that needs the pattern lattice in #657. Host route only; tool-source
  subjects are #655. No verdict is published (#651).

- Stop inventorying machine-written tool caches, so an ordinary concurrent
  test run no longer collapses the host inventory. `check` run while pytest
  was active returned `human_review_required` with *"Directory inventory
  could not complete at tests/__pycache__"*; the refusal was correct — the
  identity reader revalidates every directory it scanned, and a `.pyc`
  landing between the two reads really is a directory that changed while it
  was read — but a bytecode cache should never have been an identity-bound
  input. `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.ruff_cache`,
  `.tox` and `.nox` are excluded from the repository walk for the same
  reason `.venv`, `node_modules` and `.git` already are: no host reads
  configuration from one, so inventorying them buys no coverage. Nothing
  else is softened — a recognized host directory that changes mid-read is
  still refused with no grants, an unreadable one is still fail-closed, and
  a quiescent rerun still performs a real read rather than serving a cached
  denial or a cached completion (#598).

- Refuse a required tool source whose declared path is unavailable, once,
  for every reader. `scan` applies one availability precondition before any
  adapter runs, reading the same resolver `doctor` renders as
  `SHIP-DIAG-MISSING-SOURCE-FILE`, so the two agree by construction. The
  contract `docs/diagnostics.md` already published — a required
  `tool_sources[].path` that does not resolve is `InputParseError(3)` — was
  true of the shared loaders and `mcp_server_source` and false of
  `openai_agents_sdk`, which returned a source warning and let a required,
  absent entrypoint finish as an advisory exit-0 scan; an integration using
  execution status to tell bad input from a completed scan got a different
  answer per reader. The error names each offending source id, its declared
  path, and whether it was not found or escapes the manifest directory.
  `optional: true` sources are unchanged, keeping their warning and
  `coverage_recovery` evidence. `verify` applies the same precondition per
  tree: a base commit declaring a path absent from that tree reports
  `base_status: "scan_failed"` with the reason in `base_notes` and no
  capability delta, and does not move the head gate. Missing input is named,
  never repaired by an invented declaration (#585).

- Read every counted hunk row, so header-shaped content stops being lost.
  Hunk state and the header's declared row counts, not a line's spelling,
  decide what the shared unified-diff parser treats as content: a removed
  `---` renders as `----` and a removed `-- note` renders as `--- note`,
  and matching those against the file-header prefixes dropped the row and,
  in the second case, replaced the file's identity with the invalid-path
  sentinel. A plain Markdown horizontal-rule removal now reaches a complete
  structural comparison instead of an unnecessary `human_review_required`.
  Truncated and over-declared hunks still end at the first line that cannot
  be hunk data, keep their short row list, and are still refused by the
  declared-count comparison; path, rename, no-newline and malformed-header
  contracts are unchanged (#611).

- Name what a change did to the bound each finding depends on.
  `tool_surface_diff.finding_attributions[]` projects the shipped
  `openapi_delete/v1` and `sdk_boolean_guard/v1` comparisons onto active
  findings and separates a standing weakness, an improvement that leaves the
  finding standing, and a newly widened capability — three cases the identity
  bucket reports as one. Only evidence naming a finding's own fingerprint
  classifies; same-capability evidence can withdraw a negative claim but never
  establish one, a display name is never a join, two active findings sharing one
  fingerprint are unresolvable, and findings that could not be joined to any
  profile — including any carrying neither a fingerprint nor an id — are counted
  in `tool_surface_diff.unattributed_findings` and printed beside the rows. A run with no base asks no diff
  question and emits no rows. Dependency coverage remains
  incomplete, exclusion eligibility remains false, and no finding, fingerprint,
  severity, baseline, exit code or release decision changes. No `--scope`
  option and no receipt question are added (#515).

- Bind reader-selected input directory names and no-follow entry kinds in the
  verification plan. Both current-control observations and worker replay now
  reject changed membership, including ignored additions with unchanged file
  hashes. Exact output exclusions work across archived and live trees without
  hiding new source siblings. Cached listings retain bounds; refused captures
  remain explicit. Plans without directory capture require a fresh run (#630).

- Reconfirm recorded verification inputs before returning current control,
  including ignored and Git-hidden changes. Preserve each live policy,
  baseline and comparison origin through portable copying; generated and
  outside-repository imports remain frozen artifacts. Prepare exports captured
  auxiliary bytes, and all live reads retain bounded no-follow validation.
  Legacy external-input plans need a fresh run when their origin is ambiguous.
  Directory-source membership is captured separately below (#627).

- Route host-only repositories from first discovery to the existing host audit
  without a placeholder manifest. The CLI and zero-install script retain
  ignored and malformed config candidates; incomplete traversal and config
  directories remain explicit inspection routes. `init` and `bootstrap`
  hand off without setup writes. Contract v33 adds filename-only applicability
  fields; the release gate and permission model are unchanged (#568).
  `host_discovery_incomplete_paths` names only what can actually conceal a
  tree — a link resolving to a file is not listed — and an unreadable or
  over-budget census names the path that stopped it there instead of refusing
  the classification, matching what `audit --host` already does with the same
  failure.

- Compare supported instruction structure across verifier, local control,
  preflight, host drift and generated Claude Code edit hooks. Complete prose
  edits no longer imply permission changes; malformed/unknown structure and
  configured trust roots retain review. Raw byte currency remains mandatory.
  Contract v32 adds successor schemas and explicit conditional edit rules;
  legacy host baselines require deliberate review, and automatic prose edits
  never seed or consume per-path hook approvals (#545, #516).

- Count actual `insufficient_evidence` qualification outcomes per profile with
  denominators, case IDs, named evidence gaps and explicit unscored cases.
  Mark the legacy expected-IE metric not applicable on the three-label corpus;
  all existing scores and thresholds remain unchanged. Qualification v6 adds
  these diagnostics while preserving old artifacts without inventing coverage
  they never recorded (#520).

- Label conservative action-effect projections separately from their static
  evidence in CLI, report, PR and packet summaries. Inferred/default/unknown
  effects remain visible as provisional risks, with current pass eligibility;
  declared and structural evidence are distinct. No gate or evidence is
  upgraded by the presentation (#357).

- Retain base finding evidence for the existing fingerprint comparison and
  expose changed predicate support, sources, subjects and release contribution.
  Reports distinguish identity matches from change attribution and disclose
  missing support or ambiguous matches. The gate and legacy JSON buckets are
  unchanged; #515's default diff scope awaits dependency-coverage proof (#557).

- Show the bounded human review question at the start of existing PR comments
  and Check Run summaries, with source links, actor, outcomes, coverage limits
  and exact omitted-question counts. PR publication permission/context refusals
  retain the review in the workflow summary without changing the gate. This is
  #337's presentation slice; authenticated decision recording remains open under
  the independent signer pilot #555.

- Evaluate externally signed decisions on the bounded human review request
  without rewriting static evidence or granting authority. Full current scope,
  external host key trust, reviewer eligibility and expiry are checked;
  acceptance, rejection and dispute remain separate from the release gate.
  The host-neutral API returns separate evaluation evidence; GitHub acquisition
  and persistence remain #337 (runtime contract 31, control floor 21; #537).

- Publish an unsigned, content-bound human review request for one complete-evidence
  documentation-quality class. Reviewers get an exact question, scope and
  postcondition; existing gates and permissions remain unchanged. The new
  standalone schema keeps the shared control union and persisted grammars frozen
  (runtime contract 30, minimum control contract 21; #536).

- **Deprecated the path-only instruction-weakening check.** (#516)
  `SHIP-VERIFY-AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS-WEAKENED` remains registered for compatibility
  but emits no new findings. Structured permission, MCP and hook
  readers and the skill-command mention heuristic remain active. Generic trust-root and local instruction routes are
  unchanged; #545 tracks their remaining prose-only review boundary.

- **Test- and template-only agent names require review.** (#533) Discovery
  keeps these names visible with their source and rationale, but `init` no
  longer asserts them as the product's reviewed identity. A name also declared
  in product code remains eligible under the existing quality and scope rules.
  Installed and standalone detectors apply the same declaration-site floor;
  tool discovery remains available and unresolved names use the existing
  `CHANGE_ME` placeholder. The later identity-specific recovery question is
  tracked separately in #543; existing purpose/permission review remains.

- **An init generator failure is a product defect, not a request to refill a template.**
  (#328) Rendering and generated-manifest validation now use the same structured
  `internal_error` route, with no edit or `--minimal` fallback. Setup writes no
  manifest, CI workflow or instruction kit on this failure. Genuine malformed
  user manifests still name the existing file for repair.

- **The FastMCP signature projection now resolves the injected `Context`, and
  says so when it cannot read a type.** (#539) #535 made Python MCP servers
  discoverable and read their signatures. Two of the facts it published about
  those signatures could be wrong, and both were reproduced through the
  production loader: an application model named `Context` was **erased** — the
  catalog published `update() -> str` for a tool whose one required input is a
  model carrying `account_id` — and `from mcp.server.fastmcp import Context as
  RequestContext` was **not recognised**, so the value the framework supplies
  became a required `string` the caller is asked for. Both came from the same
  cause: the request context was matched on the last token of the annotation's
  spelling, while the SDK matches on the resolved class.

  The reader now answers with the module's own import and class table — the
  machinery that already follows `@mcp.tool` back to a `FastMCP(...)`
  construction, with the same prefix rule, the same refusal on a doubly-bound
  name, and one addition: the base list, because the SDK injects any *subclass*
  of its context. Qualified spellings, `import ... as` aliases, forward
  references and same-name application classes are all resolved; a name two
  statements bind and relative imports without class provenance are not, and those
  keep the parameter with `unresolved_context_identity` recorded against the
  tool rather than picking a direction silently.

  Separately, a parameter's type is now whatever its annotation **denotes**,
  read from the annotation's tree. The shared string-matching emitter answers
  `string` for everything it does not recognise, so `int | None`,
  `Annotated[int, Field(ge=1)]`, `typing.List[str]` and a Pydantic model all
  shipped as concrete string schemas on `enumerated` evidence. Containers and
  the underlying type in an `Annotated` spelling are projected where known;
  nullable unions remain partial because this one-type projection cannot
  express both a value and null. Anything unrepresentable publishes **no** type — an empty property
  schema, `untyped_parameter` or `unrepresentable_annotation` in the tool's
  `surface_gaps`, and `partial` for that tool's surface. The return annotation
  is read by the same rule, because `output_schema` came from the same
  fallback. A container's kind does not depend on what it holds —
  `Dict[str, Any]` is an object, and this projection publishes no element
  schema for any annotation, a bare `list` included — but a mapping's *key*
  does, so `dict[int, str]` is refused. The broader SDK whole-signature and
  generic-context injection boundary is tracked separately in #542.

  Nothing about the route changes: the tool keeps its name, its file and line,
  the `medium` ceiling and the exclusion ledger it already had, and a partial
  signature closes no effect, authority or binding declaration. Both readers
  move together — `tools/shipgate-detect.py` carries the same resolution and
  the shared corpus compares it field by field — and the detector's published
  verdict, frameworks and evidence are unchanged, so `script_version` stays
  `0.6.0`.

- **A changed MCP endpoint or credential reference now reaches the reviewer.**
  (#538) An ADK agent that mounts a remote MCP server declares its authority in
  the constructor: *this agent will call whatever `https://…/mcp` advertises,
  under `<ENV_VAR>`, restricted to `<filter>`*. The reader discarded all of it.
  Two workspaces differing **only** in the endpoint literal and the
  `os.environ[...]` key — same lines, same filter — produced byte-identical
  reports: empty `capability_facts`, empty `tool_surface_facts`, and a finding
  carrying the toolset kind, the source line and one agent name. Reproduced on
  `20968551`; both verdicts were `insufficient_evidence` and neither named the
  change.

  This is lost evidence, not a demonstrated unsafe pass, and the fix is
  scrupulous about the difference. `ADMIN_KEY` proves no privilege level, and
  nothing in the new output claims it does: an endpoint or credential-reference
  change is projected with the block's documented opaque-direction bucket and a
  rationale that says, in the reviewer's own output, that the direction is *not*
  established. The one axis where a direction **is** established is the tool
  filter — values gained, values lost, a filter added where there was none, a
  filter removed entirely — and only there is one claimed.

  The binding is a claim of its own, separate from leaf coverage. Each one rides
  base-to-head as four independent per-axis rows in `tool_surface_facts.policies`
  — the carriage `core/toolkit_scope.py` already uses, so there is **no report
  schema bump, no new check id and no new committed inventory or command** —
  and `inventory_path` is deliberately not one of the four. Supplying the
  reviewed inventory the scan asks for therefore *cannot* clear an endpoint,
  credential-reference or filter delta; it answers a different question.

  Identity is `<agent>:<slot>` and excludes the source line, so moving,
  reflowing or commenting the call produces no delta at all, while two agents on
  one endpoint — and one toolset shared by two agents — keep distinct
  attribution. What could not be read says so per binding: a shadowed
  constructor, a rebound `connection_params` variable, a dynamic URL, a callable
  filter and an unreadable header each record a limitation code, and only the
  claim the doubt actually reaches is dropped. Credentials written literally
  into source — URL userinfo, a sensitive query value, a hardcoded header — are
  redacted at the reader before they reach any artifact and are never hashed, so
  a change confined to those bytes is *not* named; that limit is published
  rather than implied. Nothing is imported, constructed, connected to or looked
  up in the environment: every fixture carries a module-level
  `raise RuntimeError("must never execute")`.

  `release_decision.decision` remains the only gate, the release enum and every
  qualification threshold are untouched, and the same workspace that was
  `insufficient_evidence` before still is — with the change named. The design,
  and the limits it ships with, are written up in
  [`docs/engineering/remote-binding-evidence.md`](docs/engineering/remote-binding-evidence.md).

  Review found five defects, and three of them were the same mistake: reasoning
  about a framework's semantics from the shape of the data instead of from the
  framework. **`tool_filter=[]` is not a filter of nothing, it is no filter** —
  ADK's `_is_tool_selected` returns `True` for any falsy filter, so an empty
  list exposes every advertised tool, and comparing it as the empty *set*
  reported the widest state as the narrowest. **A stdio connection does not
  carry `env` inline** — `StdioConnectionParams` nests a `StdioServerParameters`
  under `server_params`, so reading only the outer call answered "this binding
  has no credential" about one that plainly did. And **a URL query key is
  classified after decoding, against a credential-*name* rule rather than a
  fixed list**, because `api%5Fkey` is `api_key` to every server that reads it
  and `access_token` was in no vocabulary the redaction pass held.

  Two more were silent losses rather than wrong answers. A capability member's
  id is hashed from its subject, and a subject without the configured source id
  merged two same-named agents from different sources into one member —
  deleting one source's endpoint change. And a hardcoded credential added
  beside an existing environment reference was recorded only as a limitation,
  which the carried summary and hash never saw, so a *credential being added*
  produced no delta; the credential axis now lists every entry, with
  `<literal credential withheld>` in place of a value it will not publish.

- **Python MCP servers get the route the survey said they needed most.**
  (#484) #431 shipped a built-in registry of tool-registration idioms covering
  TypeScript and Go, and its own 30-server survey named what it left out:
  Python's `@mcp.tool` decorator, the largest single shape by both repositories
  and call sites. `redis/mcp-redis`, `chroma-core/chroma-mcp` and
  `neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j` were all in the state MongoDB and Grafana were in
  before #431 — `detect` returned `is_agent_project: false` for a first-party
  server publishing dozens of tools. All three are now read, and so is the one
  the survey measured as the largest of all: `awslabs/mcp` yields **262 tools**
  with 179 registrations recorded as unenumerable.

  It is a sixth idiom (`py_fastmcp_decorator`) and a different **extraction
  mechanism**, which is why it waited for its own increment and its own probe
  list. Three facts about the shape are why it could not be a sixth pattern:
  the name is usually *not written down* — `@mcp.tool()` on `def dbsize()`
  registers `dbsize`, which is all 53 of `redis/mcp-redis`'s registrations; the
  input schema is the **annotated signature**, so this idiom publishes one
  where the lexical idioms genuinely have nothing to publish; and whether the
  decorator registers anything at all is a **binding fact**, since `@app.tool`
  is a tool registration when `app` is a server and somebody else's decorator
  otherwise. So it is read with the standard library's parser, it follows the
  decorated name back to a server construction — across modules, because
  `redis/mcp-redis` constructs its server in `src/common/server.py` and
  decorates in `src/tools/*.py` — and it refuses out loud when it cannot.

  Two findings changed the design after it was measured rather than before.
  The official Python SDK's v2 **renamed `FastMCP` to `MCPServer`** and left
  `mcp.server.fastmcp` as a module that only raises; 41 of `awslabs/mcp`'s
  servers had already moved, and a reader that knew one name read 105 tools
  where there are 334. And every one of `neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j`'s 40 tools is
  registered as `name=namespace_prefix + "…"`, so the rule the lexical idioms
  use — offer no route without a resolved name — would have reported that
  repository as "not an agent project" *because* its names are dynamic. A
  Python site carries its own provenance, having already been followed back to
  a server construction, so the route is offered and the evidence says "40
  registration(s), none of which this reader can name". A committed export
  cannot displace such a route either: containment is the test, and an export
  contains an empty set of names vacuously.

  Nothing is claimed more loudly for having been read more closely. The
  ceiling stays `medium`, and every way the registered identity can differ
  from the one on the page is a recorded omission rather than a guess: a name
  built at run time, a `**options` unpacking that can carry `name`, a
  decorator *below* the registration whose return value is what the server
  actually receives, and an object this reader cannot follow to a server at
  all — `@self.mcp.tool` on an injected server, `app = create_server()` on a
  factory's result. All four are measured in `awslabs/mcp`.
  `IDIOM_REGISTRY_VERSION` is `2` and `TRIGGER-MCP-TOOL-REGISTRATION-SOURCE`
  routes `@mcp.tool`.

  A committed export displaces this route only when it accounts for
  *everything* the route found, unreadable registrations included. An export
  naming every tool the reader could read looks like containment and is not:
  withholding the route then sends the reader to the export and never to
  `scan`, so the registration nobody could name reaches no exclusion ledger —
  a measured miss turning back into a silent one.

  Every dependency table the gate names is reachable, which took a second
  pass to be true: the walker read a Poetry table's *constraint* where the
  distribution is the key, so `mcp = "^1.6.0"` produced `^1.6.0` and never
  `mcp` — three of the five tables named in the constant were dead, and a
  Poetry-managed server got no route at all. Both halves of a table are
  admitted now, and all five are exercised.

  The zero-install detector moved in the same commit, to `0.6.0`: #485 made
  `tools/shipgate-detect.py` a second implementation of this reader, and
  `tests/mcp_idiom_corpus.py` is what keeps it from becoming a different one —
  every case either reader has been asked about lives there once, the whole
  Python probe list and the cross-module trees included, and both are driven
  through all of it and compared site by site, span by span. Both detectors
  return identical verdicts, sources and evidence on all four live
  repositories.

- **Adoption evidence now has a counting mechanism, and its first published
  number is a zero.** (#475) This project collects nothing — local-first and
  static by default, no telemetry, no account — and the price of that stance is
  that it cannot count its own users. Downloads measure CI caches and stars
  measure sentiment, so neither is adoption. The new root-level
  [`ADOPTERS.md`](ADOPTERS.md) is the opt-in registry that pays the price
  honestly: one row per adopter, added by the adopter through an
  [issue form](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adopter_entry.yml) or a pull request,
  naming what they gate, whether it runs as local evaluation, advisory CI or
  blocking CI, the date, and a link to the public act where they asked. Private
  repositories are listed at organization granularity — the word `private` and
  nothing else. An entry is removed on request, without a reason.

  It ships with an eight-rule **claims policy** (no entry, no claim; every
  number carries its as-of date; external and dogfooding are never summed; an
  entry is a dated statement rather than a measurement; a tier is self-reported
  and never upgraded; a badge is not an entry; the design-partner ledger stays
  separate; removal is unconditional), an optional tier-neutral README badge
  that links back to the registry, and the maintainer dogfooding entry the
  acceptance asks for — which reads `advisory CI`, not `blocking CI`, because
  `main` requires no status check and a red run there stops no merge.

  The policy is enforced rather than promised. `tests/test_adopters_registry.py`
  parses both tables and fails on a row missing a field, an undefined tier, a
  non-ISO or future date, a `Repository` that is neither one resolvable public
  link — on any host, so a GitLab or self-hosted adopter is not pushed into
  writing `private` about a public repository — nor `private` itself, an entry
  link that does not point into this repository, **two rows covering the same
  adopter and repository**, this repository listed as an *external* adopter,
  counts that disagree with the rows, an as-of date older than the newest
  entry, a claims rule quietly dropped, a second badge variant, an issue form
  that drifts from the registry's vocabulary or stops requiring consent — and
  any adopter number stated anywhere in the repository's prose that these rows
  cannot source. That last check reads the claim's **own sentence**: a
  neighbouring sentence about dogfooding does not qualify it, and a claim that
  calls itself external never borrows the maintainer count. A 50-case
  perturbation sweep confirmed every one of those fails on the weakening it
  exists to catch, and that the legitimate edits — a correctly added adopter, a
  GitLab-hosted one, a second maintainer row, a grammatically singular count —
  still pass.

- **One unreadable application root no longer rejects every agent name in the
  repository.** (#398) A declared root whose identity cannot be established
  statically makes nothing selectable — the #324 rule, and a sound one, because
  every name still standing is by construction *not* that root. It was being
  applied with repository scope. On adk-samples that meant one file rejected
  roughly 55 candidates across 25 projects, `financial_coordinator` and
  `cyber_guardian_orchestrator` among them, and told the reader so by naming a
  file in a project they were not adopting. The rejection is now scoped to the
  project the root sits in — the same grouping `agent_project_candidates`
  publishes, now computed once and read by both — and the sentence names that
  project. A name several projects declare is still rejected when any of them
  is blocked; that direction is the fail-closed one.

  "Which project" is resolved against the projects that grouping actually
  *established*, not against the nearest project marker. The two are not the
  same, and reading the marker fails open: a utilities package carrying its own
  `pyproject.toml` but no agent evidence is not a manifest scope, so a bare
  `Agent(name="CrmHelper")` found there was exempt from the workspace's refusal
  and plain `init --write` wrote a helper class's argument as the reviewed
  identity of a repository whose real application root could not be read at
  all. A name under no established project belongs to the scope enclosing it.

  Scoping alone would not have unblocked the reproduction, because one of the
  two observed culprits was `eval/test_eval_arize.py` *inside* the project
  being adopted and the other was
  `.agents/skills/**/resources/templates/app/agent.py`. Neither is the
  application a project ships: a fixture that builds an `App` is a fixture, and
  a scaffolding template is what a generator copies. The ranker already said so
  for *selection* and said the opposite for *rejection* — one predicate now
  answers both, so a scaffolding template is demoted exactly as a test fixture
  is instead of standing in for the product. The template rule is the directory
  pair `resources/templates/`, not a bare `templates/`, which real packages
  use; an unreadable root anywhere else still stops selection, and a project
  whose own product root is unreadable still refuses with `CHANGE_ME`.

  One consequence is worth stating rather than discovering: where the *only*
  agent evidence in a workspace is non-product code, an unreadable root there
  used to force `CHANGE_ME`, and now the fixture or template name is written.
  That guard was accidental — a readable root in the same file already had its
  name written before this change — so what this does is make the two cases
  agree, not open a new one. The general rule it points at, that a name only
  non-product code declares should never be asserted as the reviewed identity,
  is [#533](https://github.com/ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate/issues/533); it
  would close the readable case too and is a wider decision than this fix. The
  same widening reaches `init --write --allow-unresolved-scope`, whose whole
  contract is already "adopt the first agent name it parsed" on a workspace
  with several unrelated projects.

  `tools/shipgate-detect.py` carries the same change (`script_version`
  `0.6.0`): `agent_name_candidates` is the field the zero-install path pins
  byte for byte, so a script that scoped the rejection differently would name a
  different agent than `init` does. Putting the grouping behind one object on
  each side surfaced two parity breaks that predate this issue.

  The script counted **every** `Agent(name=…)` literal as project evidence,
  where the CLI counts only framework-attributed ones. A module defining its
  own `Agent` class and constructing `Agent(name="crm")` is not an agent
  project (#363 review), so the script drew a boundary the CLI does not: a
  phantom entry in `agent_project_candidates` and, through it, `agent_scope:
  "ambiguous"` on a workspace the CLI calls `"single"` — a *verdict*
  disagreement on the surface whose whole contract is verdict parity. The
  script now qualifies those literals the same way, snapshotting each Python
  file's framework attribution right after the Python pass, which is exactly
  what `_score_python_signals` records on the CLI side.

  And where no marker was found above the evidence at all, the script named the
  workspace's `requirements.txt` as the project marker while the CLI reported
  `null`. A weak marker only draws a boundary in a directory that already holds
  agent evidence, so one that unlocked nothing is not the boundary the project
  rests on. Every sample carries a `pyproject.toml` and one readable root,
  which is why the per-sample parity check reached neither; tests do now.

- **The human entry path reaches one useful review, and is checked like every
  other distribution surface.** (#498) The README was 933 lines with 28
  second-level sections, and the quickstart opened with three commands before
  the reader had seen a result. Both were also wrong in ways nobody was
  checking, because `README.md` and `docs/quickstart.md` were recorded in
  [`docs/distribution-surfaces.md`](docs/distribution-surfaces.md) as
  "repository documentation" and therefore registered nowhere: the quickstart's
  first command was `shipgate check --format agent-boundary-json`, which the
  release the same page tells a reader to install rejects outright — `v0.15.0`
  accepts only `codex-boundary-json` — and its placeholder step sent a coding
  agent to the README for `agent.declared_purpose`, a declaration only a person
  may make. The README's flagship "what your PR sees" block quoted a comment
  with an `### Agents Shipgate result: block` heading and an
  `Impact | Change | Subject | Why` table, called it verbatim, and no code path
  rendered any of it; `block` is not a value any verdict field takes.

  The README is now a landing page: one before/after capability change, one
  demo, one install, the accuracy numbers that are still zero, and an
  audience-routing table. [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) is one
  review end to end on the committed `ai_generated_refund_pr` sample — what
  changed, why the top result matters, what the run did not establish, that
  **exit zero is not merge permission**, and who owns the next action — before
  either adoption route, and it opens with a channel table saying which build
  provides which commands. Displaced README material moved into the docs that
  own it, with a mapping table from every retired anchor.

  Three guards keep it there. `README.md` and `docs/quickstart.md` are a
  registered `human_entry_path` surface and `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-recipes.md`,
  `docs/agents/` and `docs/target-repo-agent-snippets.md` a registered
  `agent_instructions` surface, so the placeholder-ownership and pin rules that
  already covered the design-partner runbook now cover them too;
  `test_the_human_entry_path_states_what_the_published_build_provides` reads the
  `--format` values the published tag accepts out of the tag and fails if the
  entry path teaches one it does not, the way #506 reads that tag's
  `CONTRACT_VERSION`; and
  `test_the_entry_path_quotes_lines_the_pr_comment_actually_renders` runs the
  fixture and compares every quoted comment line against the artifact. The
  vocabulary reader learned to see a Markdown reference table, which is the only
  shape the entry path states a verdict set in. Four unresolvable
  `uvx agents-shipgate@0.18.0` pins in `docs/incidents/` and `samples/README.md`
  named a version the index does not carry; they now name the checkout, and say
  what to pin once a release carries the fixture.

- **The zero-install detector refuses an oversized candidate instead of
  reading it.** `tools/shipgate-detect.py` is fetched over `curl | python3`
  and run against repositories nobody has inspected, and it read every
  glob-matched MCP/OpenAPI/Conductor candidate — and every n8n and Conductor
  workflow it scored a framework off — with an unbounded `read_text()`. A
  multi-hundred-megabyte `*mcp*.json` was pulled into memory whole. The input
  adapters have always refused such a file before parsing it
  (`MAX_INPUT_FILE_BYTES`, 10 MB), so this was also a parity break: the file
  was *excluded* by `agents-shipgate detect --json` and *suggested* by the
  script, and an agent following the script would write a `tool_sources` entry
  the next `scan` rejects. Both sides now ask the same content-independent
  question from `stat` alone, and the script spells the refusal exactly as the
  CLI does, so `excluded_sources` agrees on the reason and not just the split.

  CLI discovery had the mirror-image hole: `_looks_like_n8n_workflow` and the
  Conductor framework probe read their glob hits whole to score a framework
  whose adapter would then refuse the same file, and the MCP host-config sniff
  in `_probe_failure_reason` re-read a file the adapter had *just* rejected for
  being too large. All three are bounded now. The size gate is asked before the
  script's YAML early return: a `.yaml` OpenAPI spec is still never excluded on
  content the stdlib cannot parse, but size needs no parser.

- **The design-partner pilot now measures a reviewer's decision and the next
  eligible change — and its first published number is a zero with a reason.**
  (#521) The runbook counted three partners through one PR each and exited on a
  first-run feedback note, which cannot answer whether a reviewer made a better
  decision or whether anyone ran it again.
  [`docs/design-partner-verifier-pilot.md`](docs/design-partner-verifier-pilot.md)
  now names two routes under test, six denominators that failures stay inside,
  first value as four things a reviewer who did not write the change can name
  plus a recorded decision, a four-week window for the second eligible change,
  three separately-granted consents, and a **pre-registered**
  continue/narrow/stop rule. Ten minutes to first value is stated as an
  experiment target; a test fails if any page later restates it as a result.

  Dry-running the runbook's own commands is what produced the first result,
  across all three distribution channels. On a synthetic host-boundary change
  (three permission rules widened to `Bash(*)` / `Read(**)` / `WebFetch(*)`,
  one remote MCP server added) the released `0.15.0` returns `warn` / `none`
  with **zero** violations and no coverage surface, while the unqualified
  preview and the source tree both return `block` / `critical` with all four
  named. So a build that shows the change *is* installable — the preview —
  and it carries no qualification of any kind, which is a thing to say to a
  partner rather than a footnote. The runbook had also demanded "runtime
  contract 14" in the paragraph that installed it with `pipx install`, a
  precondition no published build has ever satisfied; #497's channel table and
  this change both retire it. And `init` then `verify` still dead-ends on
  exactly the repositories the host-boundary route is for (#498), because they
  have no tool surface to declare.

  So [`docs/design-partner-pilot-results.md`](docs/design-partner-pilot-results.md)
  publishes six external denominators at zero, a dated enrollment shortfall
  naming an unmade channel decision rather than a recruiting gap, the
  reproduced blockers routed to #506, #497, #520, #498 and #504 → #337 with no
  new issue opened, and a dated standing decision of **narrow**: invite Route H
  on the preview channel with its unqualified status stated in the invitation,
  and withhold the released channel for per-change review. Every finding is
  build-dated, and a guard fails the day the newest published tag moves so the
  comparison is re-run instead of carried forward — a guard the page itself
  records as insufficient, since nothing fails when a new preview is cut.

- **Everything `init` writes into an adopter's repository now names a release
  that exists.** (#506) `init --write --ci` generated
  `uses: ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate@v0.16.0`, and no such tag had ever been
  cut — GitHub fails that job at action-resolution time, so a first-time
  adopter's very first Shipgate run was a red check carrying an error about
  *our* repository rather than theirs. The bundled onboarding prompt had the
  same defect one layer up (`uvx agents-shipgate@0.16.0`, a version the index
  does not carry). Every render since 2026-07-09 pinned a nonexistent ref — 56
  days of them by the time #506 was filed.

  Two conventions coexisted and only one was correct. The docs, `llms.txt`,
  `.well-known` and the Action examples tracked the latest published tag; the
  one artifact that gets *executed* by a stranger's CI tracked `__version__`,
  which for the whole interval between releases is a version nothing can
  fetch. `LATEST_PUBLISHED_VERSION` moves into
  `src/agents_shipgate/published_release.py` as the single constant every
  surface — documentation and emitted artifact alike — derives from.

  Pinning the published release keeps the pin resolvable but does not make it
  *sufficient*, and conflating those is what the previous fix got wrong: the
  bundled prompts demand runtime contract 21, and `v0.15.0` emits contract 10.
  So the prompts now state that gap where they state the pin, rendered from
  `LATEST_PUBLISHED_CONTRACT_VERSION` — which is read back out of the tag
  itself by the suite, not asserted about it. The honest output when the newest
  published build predates the floor is to say so; it is never to pin a build
  that cannot be fetched.

  `tests/test_init_ci.py` asserted the defect, which is why it shipped. It now
  requires a published tag, and `tests/test_adopter_pins_resolve.py` sweeps
  every pin shape across everything `init` emits — driven off `SPECS`, the
  registry `--agent-instructions` itself selects from, so a target added there
  is swept the day it is registered rather than the day someone remembers.
  The sweep fails on an empty tag list rather than passing over one, asserts
  each pin shape was actually found, and carries two negative controls that
  re-introduce the defect. Cutting `v0.16.0` is not what fixes this: the rule
  is "names a tag that exists", so it holds on the first commit after the tag
  too.

- **Four lexer defects in the MCP registration reader, fixed in both
  implementations.** (#485 review) Found reviewing the zero-install port; all
  four were in the reader #431 shipped, so the port had copied them rather than
  introduced them. Two invent a tool name, which is the one outcome a reader of
  a *name* cannot afford, and two lose a whole file's surface:

  - A `${…}` holds code, so a brace inside a string, comment, regex or nested
    template is not a structural brace. ``const msg = `brace: ${"{"}`;`` left
    the substitution open and consumed the rest of the file as one unterminated
    template — every registration after that line gone, and a workspace
    declaring an MCP dependency reported as "not an agent project" over a brace
    in a string.
  - A line break ends a JavaScript initializer only when what follows cannot
    continue the expression. `static toolName = "safe"` with `+ "_delete"` on
    the next line published `safe` at `medium` confidence for a tool the server
    registers as `safe_delete`.
  - The regex heuristic now resolves the keyword in front of a slash from the
    *masked* source. Read from the raw text, a comment between `if` and its
    condition hid the keyword, the slash was read as division, and the pattern
    was scanned as code — reporting a tool invented out of a regex body, which
    is precisely what masking exists to make impossible.
  - A backslash before CRLF is one line continuation, not `\r` plus a line
    break. The identical file resolved its registration on a Unix checkout and
    lost it on a Git-for-Windows one.

  Each is an expected-result case in `tests/mcp_idiom_corpus.py`, so both
  readers are pinned to the corrected behaviour rather than to each other's
  agreement, and the CRLF sweep now has a continuation case that actually
  exercises it. The three vendor servers this input exists for are unaffected —
  61, 114 and 114 tools before and after.

- **The zero-install detector reads MCP registration sites, so it stops
  telling vendor MCP server maintainers to stop.** (#485) `tools/shipgate-detect.py`
  is the documented first command run against a repository that has *not*
  adopted Shipgate — which is every repository #431 was about. #431 taught the
  installed CLI to read a tool's name out of a TypeScript or Go registration
  site; the script did not gain it, so the two disagreed on the one question
  the script exists to answer: `mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server` (61 tools),
  `github/github-mcp-server` (110) and `grafana/mcp-grafana` (114) were agent
  projects to the CLI and "Stop, not an agent project" to the script. The
  masking lexer, the five idioms, the path predicate, the dependency gate and
  the export-precedence rule are now all in the script too, stdlib-only.

  Porting a load-bearing matcher means a second implementation of it, which is
  this repository's recurring bug class. What makes it affordable is that the
  two are not allowed to become *different* implementations: every case either
  reader has ever been asked about now lives once in `tests/mcp_idiom_corpus.py`
  — every idiom's positive sample, the whole adversarial sweep, the path
  predicate's cases and both escape grammars — and both readers are driven
  through all of it, compared site by site including each site's byte span.
  `samples/mcp_source_only_server` puts the route inside the existing
  `samples/` parity sweep, nine constructed workspaces pin the branches around
  it (covering export, partial export, wildcard export, no dependency, no
  resolved registration, test-only registrations, two registration
  directories), and `test_framework_vocabulary_names_every_cli_omission` now
  passes with an empty `known_omissions`.

  One defect surfaced while porting and is fixed in both: with no MCP export in
  the workspace at all, `_covering_export` returned every resolved name as
  "uncovered", and the caller renders a shortfall as *"An MCP tool export is
  also present and does not name N of these registrations"*. A server whose
  surface exists only as source is the population this input was built for, so
  that claim about a file that does not exist was published into the adoption
  evidence for every one of them.

- **Ten distribution surfaces, one registry, and a test that they agree with
  the engine.** (#497) One engine is published through `action.yml`, `plugins/`,
  `skills/`, `adoption-kits/`, `harness/`, `examples/`, `prompts/`, `policies/`,
  `tools/` and the MCP server, and nothing checked that they said the same
  thing. `docs/distribution-surfaces.md` now lists every one of them, what it
  claims, and which test proves the claim;
  `tests/test_distribution_surface_parity.py` is that test, and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` points at both. A surface that answers nothing the engine
  answers still gets a row saying so — `policies/` are inputs the engine
  evaluates and the MCP server is transport — because that is what stops the
  next reader re-deriving it. A new top-level directory now fails the suite
  until somebody classifies it.

  Four things the registry found, each a surface disagreeing with the engine
  rather than with itself:

  - **The bundled setup prompt told a coding agent to write a declaration only a
    person may make.** `add-shipgate-to-repo.md` step 5 said to replace
    `agent.declared_purpose[]` with "a one-line description of what the agent
    should do", derived from the prompt or main module. `init` returns
    `control.next_action.actor: "human"` and `permissions.edit: false` for
    exactly that field. The prompt now separates the placeholder the agent owns
    (`agent.name`) from the one it must surface to a person, and quotes the
    engine's own wording. The Codex kit's recipe page and the design-partner
    runbook carried the same instruction as a blanket "replace every
    `CHANGE_ME`", and no longer do.
  - **The Claude Code kit rendered a GitHub Action tag that does not exist.**
    Its advisory CI recipe pinned `@v{{ shipgate_version }}` and
    `shipgate_version: '{{ shipgate_version }}'`, so `init
    --agent-instructions=claude-code-skill` wrote `@v0.16.0` and
    `agents-shipgate==0.16.0` into an adopter's CI — a tag and a release that
    are not published. GitHub resolves `uses:` before any step runs, so that
    workflow fails on our repository's name, not the adopter's change. Both pins
    now name the published release, as the Codex kit's identical recipe always
    did. The drift was invisible because
    `test_claude_code_skill_source_matches_renderer` skipped this one file; that
    exemption is gone, which is the actual repair.
  - **Two published surfaces demanded a runtime contract nobody could reach.**
    The Claude Code plugin's marketplace description and `plugin.json` both said
    "runtime contract 15" beside `pipx install agents-shipgate`, which yields
    contract 10. The number was a second copy of a value the bundled skill
    already states; it is now removed rather than re-synced.
  - **The design-partner runbook taught a route its own build could not run.**
    It named `v0.15.0`, demanded "runtime contract 14" — which that build has
    never implemented — floored `pip` at `>=0.13`, and then gave a read order
    starting at `control.state`, which `shipgate.agent_handoff/v1` does not
    emit. It now names one channel per partner (released, unqualified preview,
    source checkout) with the contract each implements, and says what the
    released build does *not* produce instead of implying it does.

  The registry is checked against the code in **both** directions — roots,
  claims and the proving test named for each claim — and a claim must be proved
  by a test that both exists and matches at least one file on that surface.
  Review found both halves of that mattering immediately: the first draft's
  `harness` row named a proving test that had been renamed out of existence, and
  `design_partner_runbook` registered `executable_pin` while carrying only a
  `>=` install floor no pin pattern looked at. Surfaces now also state the
  engine's verdict vocabulary or none of it: a braced set literal must name the
  whole set, and a `merge_verdict == '…'` comparison must name a value the
  engine emits.

  Review of the harness itself found three more, each reproduced before it was
  fixed. The pin scanner never read the Action's own `shipgate_version:` input,
  which `action.yml` turns into `pip install agents-shipgate==<value>` — so a
  workflow could name a valid Action ref beside a package version that was never
  released. The vocabulary guard projected each documented set onto the expected
  values before comparing, so adding `needs_a_wizard` to the setup prompt's
  otherwise-complete release-decision set still compared equal; sets are now
  judged by all of their members, and a literal mixing the two vocabularies
  fails instead of being skipped by both. And requiring tags in CI was landed in
  `ci.yml` only, while `release-verify.yml` — which `release.yml` and
  `release-rehearsal.yml` both call — still checked out the candidate shallow
  and tagless before running the whole suite, so the release path would have
  gone red on a green PR. That checkout is fixed and the contract is now
  asserted for every job that runs the suite, whichever workflow adds one next.

  #485 and #506 landed while this was in review, which is the first real test of
  the exemption mechanism: all three registered gaps flipped to `XPASS`, their
  strict markers failed, and the exemptions had to be removed to get back to
  green. `KNOWN_GAPS` is empty because it worked, and the registry records what
  each gap was rather than quietly dropping it. The same merge removed a
  duplicate: #506's `agents_shipgate.published_release` and its pin-shape table
  are now imported rather than restated, leaving this harness the half that file
  does not reach — pins committed under a registered surface, found by path. That
  immediately caught an `@main` in a committed CI example, which turns out to be
  the one case #497's rule allows — an explicit version incompatibility rather
  than an unresolvable pin — so it is enumerated as a declared exception whose
  file has to say why, and an unexplained `@main` elsewhere still fails.

  Known divergences are rows, not omissions. `#485`'s exact case — a minimized
  TypeScript and Go MCP server whose tool surface exists only as registration
  sites — is now a fixture under `tests/fixtures/distribution_parity/` and a
  parity row that fails today and passes the day the port lands, with
  `xfail(strict=True)` so the exemption itself fails once it is unnecessary.
  `#506`'s two unpublished-pin gaps are recorded the same way, against a ledger
  of exactly the files that diverge, so a newly drifting file fails loudly
  instead of inheriting a surface-wide excuse. Resolvability is judged offline
  against committed release metadata; the live tag check stays in
  `release-tag-consistency`, for the reason that job already records.

- **No corpus case is graded against `insufficient_evidence` any more, and four
  `blocked` cells hold one case instead of two.** (#520, #508) A verdict exists
  to route a change somewhere: `passed` merges, `review_required` hands a human
  a named capability, `blocked` stops. `insufficient_evidence` routes nowhere —
  it is what the gate says when *its own* extraction failed, which is a
  statement about shipgate rather than about the change. So it cannot be the
  answer to "what should a correct gate do here?", and both named release
  policies stop demanding cases that expect it: `beta` goes from 28 strata /
  100 cases to 21 / 80, `pre_1_0` from 28 / 56 to 21 / 38. The value stays in
  the enum, the verifier still emits it, and it is scored as a miss against
  whatever the case expected — a coverage failure, which is what it is.

  The first blind labelling round is what settled it. All four cases where both
  independent raters chose `insufficient_evidence` had named a capability the
  diff introduced, so they could have decided; one slot sourced as
  `insufficient_evidence` was placed at `blocked` by both raters; and 12 of the
  15 slots for the outcome had been sourced from the engine's own verdict.

  The same round measured a second thing: of the seven profiles, only four
  produce a real-world `blocked` case at all, and each produces exactly one. So
  `openai_agents_sdk`, `langchain_crewai`, `google_adk` and
  `coding_agent_trust_roots` now ask for one `blocked` case rather than two.
  Filling those cells to two is reachable today only by building four more
  constructions, and a cell filled with constructions measures our imagination
  rather than the world. **No rate moved.** Every exact-match floor is still
  production's rate applied to the population it governs, rounded up —
  `minimum_blocked_exact` falls to 10 because there are 10 `blocked` cases, at
  the same 100% demand — and the origin floor stays 40% of the corpus, which is
  why holding it at a fixed *count* was refused: that would have raised
  production's demand to half the corpus as a side effect of deleting a
  decision. `docs/release-evidence-policy-decision.md` § Amendment 3 records
  the ruling, and `benchmark/safety-qualification/strata-inventory.md` records
  the per-cell evidence for the scarcity.

- **A preview wheel now reports one version, not two.** (#491) The first
  published preview stamped `pyproject.toml` and not
  `src/agents_shipgate/__init__.py`, so its METADATA said
  `0.16.0+preview.20260902.gcc59410` while `--version` said plain `0.16.0` —
  the exact confusion the local version segment exists to prevent. `doctor` was
  collateral: comparing `installed_version` against `imported_version`, it
  reported `installed_version_differs` and told the user two copies were
  shadowing each other, on an environment holding one.

  The build now stamps both sites and proves each with its own round trip over
  a closed file set, but the durable guard is on the artifact: it opens the
  wheel it just built and requires `METADATA: Version` to equal the packaged
  `__version__`. That fails on any future divergence however the stamping is
  written. A companion test pins the committed tree to exactly two version
  sites that already agree, so a third one cannot be added and silently left
  unstamped.

- **Releases run on a cadence, and work that cannot be tagged can still be
  installed.** (#491) 81% of this changelog had never reached a user: 5,039 of
  6,242 lines sat under `## Unreleased`, two milestones were complete and
  untagged, and the newest published build was 56 days old. The cause was not
  the pipeline, which is sound; it was that releases were gated on a single
  expensive artifact (#456), so they happened when that artifact happened.

  Three things change. **The cadence is a policy with a number** —
  `docs/release-runbook.md` § Cadence fixes a 30-day interval and a 45-day
  defect threshold, and `scripts/release_cadence.py` prints days-since-release
  into every CI job summary, warning once the interval lapses. It warns rather
  than fails: a red check would fail whichever unrelated change arrived after
  the interval lapsed, and that author cannot cut a release.

  **An unqualified preview channel exists**, and the finding that admits it is
  recorded in `docs/release-evidence-policy-decision.md` § Amendment 2 —
  including the cases that would have made it inadmissible. `release-preview.yml`
  publishes a GitHub pre-release at `preview-<version>` carrying one wheel,
  built from a commit CI has already accepted using the release's own
  hash-locked toolchain. Five properties keep it from being read as a release,
  each with a negative control: a PEP 440 **local** version segment, which a
  public index must refuse — so an unqualified build can never consume the
  `0.16.0` that PyPI's immutability would then make permanent; a ref outside
  the `v*` trigger namespace; a separate workflow file, so `stage` cannot find
  it when it looks for the mandatory rehearsal; no qualification artifact, so
  `verify_safety_qualification_release.py` rejects it on both the missing
  artifact and `tag == v<version>`; and `--prerelease`, so it is never
  `Latest`. Nothing in the release path was widened to accommodate it —
  `build_manifest` still requires `tag == v<version>`, and a preview simply
  produces no candidate manifest.

  **The release note is separated from the record.** `## Unreleased` had grown
  to 338,932 characters — 2.7x the 125,000-character limit the release body is
  checked against — so no tag could have been cut from it whatever else was
  green. `CHANGELOG.md` now carries one line per change, and the full reviewed
  prose moved verbatim to `docs/changelog/<version>.md`. Nothing was dropped:
  all 165 entries are byte-identical in the record and all 165 have a line in
  the note.

  This does not shorten what `v0.16.0` still needs. The signed qualification
  artifact (#456), the four `SAFETY_QUALIFICATION_*` variables and a real
  `signer_identity` remain preconditions, and a preview is not evidence toward
  any of them.

## 0.16.0

Two milestones of engine work: the evidence-first declaration workflow, the
capability delta as a standalone attestation, a route for MCP servers whose
tool surface exists only as code, the compact agent-control envelope across
every setup command, and the release-integrity pipeline that binds a published
wheel to the commit it came from.

**The full reviewed prose for every entry below is in
[`docs/changelog/0.16.0.md`](docs/changelog/0.16.0.md).** This section is the
release note; that file is the record. Nothing was dropped in the split.

**Migration notes:** 16 entries in [`STABILITY.md`](STABILITY.md) apply to this
release. Read them before upgrading from 0.15.0 — several change a published
schema or a contract version.

### Highlights

- **The capability delta is a standalone, independently verifiable
  attestation.** `verify` writes an in-toto Statement whose subject is the
  reviewed tree, and `tools/verify-capability-delta.py` re-implements its 31
  rules using nothing of ours. (#470, #469)
- **Declarations are evidence-first.** The scanner asks only what it cannot
  prove, pins every answer to the evidence behind it, and a declaration that
  contradicts what was observed is no longer accepted in silence. (#409, #410)
- **MCP servers that ship no tool export now have a route.** The official
  MongoDB and Grafana servers were reported as *not an agent project*; the new
  `mcp_server_source` input reads the tool name at its registration site.
  (#431)
- **One control envelope across the whole adoption walk.** `init`, `detect`,
  `doctor`, `preflight` and `verify` answer "what may I do next?" with one
  compact object instead of four artifacts and a guess. (#322, #323, #333,
  #339)
- **A first adoption no longer blocks itself.** The absent-input class, the
  monorepo manifest routing, the scaffold disclosure and the launcher fixes
  close the loop-breakers found in three adoption walks. (#334, #363, #384,
  #387, #389, #441)
- **Human-facing output names subjects, not identities.** Findings are grouped
  by the thing they are about, every evidence gap labels its tool the way a
  reader can use, and no surface prints a raw digest at a person. (#329, #364,
  #403, #433)
- **The release pipeline proves what it publishes.** Source-to-wheel byte
  binding, separated verification and publication with a recoverable
  transaction, a non-publishing rehearsal path, and a signed SBOM scoped to
  the shipped wheel. (#342, #343, #344, #345, #355, #356)
- **A `0.x` tag has an evidence bar it can meet**, and it is a smaller corpus
  rather than a weaker judgement: zero unsafe auto-passes, the κ floor and the
  holdout fraction are unchanged. (#341)

- MCP clients can now see when a server's reassuring annotation contradicts the evidence beside it. (#462)
- The declaration questionnaire is now pinned by something committed. (#425)
- A reviewed risk tag is the manifest refining its own row, not source evidence contradicting it. (#424)
- A `0.x` tag now has an evidence bar it can actually meet, and it is not a weaker judgement. (#341)
- One control vocabulary reaches both streams, and the adoption walk composes end to end. (#323)
- The declaration continuation: a drafted proposal can now reach the person it was drafted for. (#429)
- The route is reachable on a first adoption, and states the only order the protocol allows. (#429)
- The declaration route is reachable on a first adoption. (#429)
- `init` no longer writes a source type it guessed, and says when the block it wrote is a scaffold. (#441)
- The same MCP server declared in two files is one capability, reconciled. (#403)
- The report's `Root agent:` line names the agent instead of hashing it. (#329)
- The loader-contract failure now offers a way forward.
- A new evidence gap now says which subject left the analysed surface. (#433)
- A published tool surface is one reviewed declaration, not one row per tool. (#432)
- A coding agent can now answer the declaration questions the scanner already knows the answers to. (#410, #409)
- Control packs: the rules layer, chosen once at `init`. (#410, #413)
- Human-facing findings are grouped by subject, and a recommendation names only what is missing. (#364)
- The questionnaire asks the unread questions first. (#1745, #419)
- A confirmed declaration is pinned to the evidence behind it.
- `environment.target: template`, for a repository that ships to be copied.
- `SHIP-TRUST-MANIFEST-UNPROTECTED` reads the file GitHub would read.
- `SHIP-TRUST-MANIFEST-UNPROTECTED` — who may change the gate.
- `doctor` says which rung of the adoption ladder you are on.
- A pin re-opens when authoritative evidence is replaced, not only when a reading appears. (#357)
- Existing `capabilities.lock.json` files keep loading.
- A merged declaration block reads in manifest field order.
- One action, one permission list, with no reviewed authority either.
- Authority follows credentials, not functions: declare it once per source. (#410)
- Ask only what the scanner cannot prove, and say how much is left. (#1745, #410, #357)
- Adopter-facing output stops naming the internal identity model. (#329, #327)
- A declaration cannot discharge a category it does not cover, and a published schema keeps its bytes. (#409, #411)
- A declaration weaker than the evidence inferred for it is no longer silent. (#409, #410, #357)
- Every evidence gap now labels a tool the way a reader can use, in every gap kind. (#403)
- Every stage that narrows the analysed surface now records what it removed, and the release decision can read it. (#403, #3076, #308)
- `verify --preview` of a head that is not checked out now asks for the checkout, instead of stopping. (#397)
- `detect` now publishes the same per-candidate `init` commands `init` does when a workspace holds several agent projects. (#397)
- The first scan of an agent whose tools are imported symbols now scaffolds both layers it needs, instead of emitting nothing. (#361)
- Every `<REVIEW_REQUIRED>` in `suggested-declarations.yaml` now says what a legal answer is. (#388, #268)
- `display_literal` now escapes Unicode noncharacters alongside the invisible code points it already covered. They are the same hazard — nothing reaches the reader, so two repository objects render identically — and two of them are worse: PyYAML rejects U+FFFE and U+FFFF outright, so an agent name carrying one made the generated declaration scaffold unparseable, because the document quoting that name in a comment could not be loaded at all. The encoding stays injective, so `undisplay_literal` still recovers the name.
- `verify --preview` on a monorepo now names the project the pull request actually changed, instead of a repository root that `init` refuses. (#394)
- `detect`'s glob-based source suggestion re-ran the whole git inventory walk once per pattern — fifteen walks for one pass. `_candidate_files_matching` now accepts an inventory the caller already built, which both fixes that and is what lets the preview evidence probe ask the *same* suggestion rule about a single directory rather than keeping a second copy of it.
- Project discovery no longer presents a truncated candidate list as a complete one. (#395)
- Google ADK extraction confidence is now measured on the module, not hardcoded. (#393)
- A tool inventory now completes the source that asked for it, instead of shadowing it. (#386)
- An input that is not there is no longer reported as an input with the wrong shape, and no command creates the workspace it was asked to inspect. (#389, #384)
- A manifest type mismatch is an edit, not a bug report. (#387)
- A Google ADK sub-agent's tools are part of the analyzed surface, and a tool the gate did not look at can no longer go unmentioned. (#385)
- One command runs Agents Shipgate from this checkout, and `doctor` now says which Shipgate answered. (#334, #338, #322)
- The launcher announces a spelling the operating system will actually start.
- Two virtual environments over one base are no longer one interpreter.
- `PATH` lookup follows the shell's rule, not "a file exists there".
- A trampoline target must be a command, not a mention of one.
- A quoted program token is read before it is judged to be ours.
- A `#!/bin/sh` console-script wrapper reports the interpreter it `exec`s.
- An `insufficient_evidence` verdict now leads with the gap you can close, and the three lines that announce it agree. (#362)
- Verifier schema `0.8 → 0.9`.
- The PR comment reports the proven fact, not the routing flag.
- The policy comparator honors the split check-id aliases.
- Accepted debt survives the split.
- The headline is bounded once, at the end.
- Unicode format controls are stripped from headline material.
- The verifier headline leads with the release blockers, not with the governance notice that outranked them. (#1917, #365)
- A first adoption no longer reports a policy weakening that could not have happened.
- The blocker title quoted into the headline is normalized and bounded.
- `init` ranks agent-name candidates instead of taking the first one it trips over. (#320, #1745, #324)
- First adoption inside a monorepo no longer starts by writing the wrong manifest. (#1, #363)
- One control vocabulary across the adoption walk.
- A manifest declaration a person owes is no longer routed to the agent. (#323)
- The `AgentControl` union is unchanged, and the compatibility floor stays at `21`.
- A completion cannot rest on a negative verdict.
- A manifest that is not UTF-8 is refused, not rewritten.
- The envelope only calls a string a command when something can run it.
- `control.next_action.path` names the file byte for byte.
- Every `doctor --json` payload carries the route, including the earliest failure.

## 0.15.0 - 2026-07-07

- **First real-history accuracy numbers, published.** The 2026-W26 mined
  corpus (120 merged PRs from stripe/agent-toolkit, block/goose, and
  pydantic-ai) is now labeled (two independent AI labelers, disagreement
  0/10, third-pass adjudicated — pending human spot-check) and scored. On the
  10 PRs the gate engaged, it never wrongly passed an authority-bearing change
  (`needs_human_caught` 1.0, `benign_escalation_rate` 0.0) but also never
  cleanly passed a safe one (`ie_rate_on_safe` 0.5, plus a since-fixed scan
  crash). Full confusion matrix and method in
  [`benchmark/miner/README.md`](benchmark/miner/README.md); the README status
  banner now carries the numbers instead of "none published yet". Real history
  contributes no `must_block` rows, so blocked-recall stays with the
  constructed-adversarial stratum.
- **Config-bound dynamic-toolkit capability detection.** New checks
  `SHIP-CAP-CONFIG-BINDING-REMOVED` (high, suppression-immune) and
  `SHIP-CAP-CONFIG-BINDING-CHANGED` (review item) close the pilot blind spot
  where a diff removed or retargeted a factory's config binding — silently
  expanding the effective tool surface — without any capability delta showing
  in the diff. A conservative same-file config tracer (json/yaml/toml loads,
  `os.environ`, in-file pydantic settings) feeds them; `config → unknown`
  never fires, guarding against false positives.
- **Duplicate `action_surface` action_id collisions degrade instead of
  crashing.** A base reference serialized by a pre-#226 engine could still
  crash `scan`/`verify` at diff time with `Config error: Duplicate
  action_surface action_id`; it now degrades to a source warning
  (review_required), matching the OpenAPI fix in #226. This eliminated the
  four `scan_failed` rows in the W26 corpus.
- **Claude Code plugin marketplace.** The repo now doubles as a Claude Code
  plugin marketplace (`/plugin marketplace add ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate`,
  then `/plugin install agents-shipgate@agents-shipgate`) — the symmetric
  counterpart of the existing Codex marketplace. The plugin is skill-only
  (the auto-triggering skill + the namespaced `/agents-shipgate:shipgate`
  command); the scanner stays in the separately installed CLI and hooks stay
  on the explicit `install-hooks` path. Byte-identity with the canonical
  skill/command sources is test-pinned. Fixed in passing (caught by
  `claude plugin validate`): the canonical `SKILL.md` and `/shipgate`
  command shipped YAML frontmatter with an unquoted `:` in `description`,
  which Claude Code loads as silently-empty metadata — breaking
  description-based skill auto-triggering for every existing install. Both
  are now quoted, all byte-identical copies synced, and a regression test
  parses the frontmatter.

- **Contract v10 (additive): machine-readable `verify_required` on the Codex
  boundary result.** `shipgate check` already escalated to `warn` and routed
  to `verify` when a diff touched a tool surface it cannot gate; that deferral
  now also sets a top-level boolean `verify_required` on
  `shipgate.codex_boundary_result/v1`, and `verify_required` joins
  `agent_result_control_fields` in the runtime contract. Agents switch on the
  field instead of parsing warning prose; the observable pair is
  `decision="warn"` with `verify_required=true` — "no boundary rule fired,
  but capability is not yet gated: run verify before completion" (the
  escalation means a plain `allow` always has `verify_required=false`). The
  field lives on the shared `AgentResultV1` base, so the legacy
  `agent-result-schema.v1.json` carries it too and
  `agent_result_control_fields` validates against both schemas. Additive
  over v9: consumers pinned to `contract_version >= 9` keep working.

## 0.14.0 - 2026-06-30

- **Versioning: the `1.0.0-alpha` line is withdrawn; this work ships as
  `0.14.0`.** An earlier draft of this cycle briefly carried `1.0.0a1`. That
  label was withdrawn: the `report.json` schema (`report_schema_version:
  "0.28"`) is still additive-versioned and not yet frozen, the package is still
  `Development Status :: 4 - Beta`, and no real-world detection-accuracy
  baseline has been published — none of which support a `1.0` line. `0.14.0`
  continues the `0.x` contract line from `0.13.0` and carries the same
  agent-controller cleanup (see
  [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md#migration-note-0-14-0)). A `1.0` line will begin
  only when the report schema reaches `1.0` and holds without a breaking change.
- **Non-preview `verify` now fails closed on a missing `--config`.**
  `agents-shipgate verify --workspace . --config missing.yaml --json` exits
  `2` with `merge_verdict: "unknown"`, `applicability: "unknown"`, and
  `can_merge_without_human: false`; it writes lightweight verifier/controller
  artifacts but no `report.json` and runs no head scan. This replaces the old
  lenient path where a missing config could trigger-skip and exit `0`.
  `verify --preview --config missing.yaml --json` is unchanged and remains the
  setup/relevance path with exit `0`.
- **Shipgate now has a separate self-dogfood PR workflow.** The root
  `shipgate.yaml` remains the public Codex-plugin marketplace self-scan, while
  `shipgate-self.yaml` and `.github/workflows/agents-shipgate-self.yml` run an
  advisory static-only local-action gate on pull requests with
  `fail_on_merge_verdicts: blocked`, artifact upload enabled, and PR comments
  disabled. This does not scan Shipgate's Python scanner implementation; tests,
  coverage, audit, SBOM, and release signing remain that assurance path.
- **A named high concern now routes to review, not `insufficient_evidence`.**
  When a scan turns up an *active* (not baseline-accepted) high/critical review
  finding, the release decision is now `review_required` even if low-confidence
  extraction would otherwise have produced `insufficient_evidence`. Both
  verdicts are equally non-auto-mergeable, but `review_required` points the
  human at a specific, actionable finding (e.g. the new
  `SHIP-SCOPE-TOOLKIT-UNBOUNDED`) instead of the vaguer "we couldn't see
  enough." `blocked` still outranks everything; IE still fires when the only
  signal is thin extraction. The 2026-06-01 Stripe pilot's silent/IE case now
  surfaces as a routed review. `evidence_gaps` are preserved on the report
  either way, so the extraction-coverage signal is not lost.

## 0.13.0 - 2026-06-12

- **Accepted-debt exception workflow (baseline schema 0.6).** `baseline save`
  gains `--owner`, `--reason`, and `--expires` so the approval metadata the
  v0.5 provenance contract documented as "reviewer-set" is finally settable
  without hand-editing the file (which trips the integrity hash). Metadata is
  stamped on newly-accepted entries; `--apply-to-existing` fills the fields
  into existing entries that lack them — never overwriting a previously-set
  value and preserving each entry's original `recorded_at`/`run_id` history.
  Approval is declared, never inferred, matching the `human_ack` contract.
  New `baseline status` reports accepted-debt aging (owner, age, expiry,
  expiring-soon/expired/unowned summary; `--as-of` pins the date for
  reproducible CI output) and turns into an org governance gate with
  `--require-owner` / `--require-expiry` / `--max-age-days N` — exit 20 on
  violations, advisory exit 0 without gate flags. Expired entries violate
  `--require-expiry`, and entries without provenance fail every active gate
  (unknown history is ungoverned debt, not exempt debt). Legacy 0.2–0.5
  baselines still load; re-saving upgrades them to 0.6.
- **Host-grant drift detection.** `audit --host --save-baseline` records the
  current coding-agent host grants (MCP servers, Claude Code permission rules
  and hooks, workflow scopes, Codex config presence) as the acknowledged state
  in `.agents-shipgate/host-grants.json` (content-only and byte-idempotent —
  no timestamps or machine paths; the directory is already a verify trust-root
  surface, so PR edits to the snapshot stay release-visible). `audit --host
  --drift` deterministically diffs current grants against that baseline with
  per-category added/removed/changed buckets plus `expansion_signals` naming
  the authority-broadening shapes (new or **changed** server, wildcard allow
  added, `deny` or `ask` rule **removed**, hook added or **changed**, workflow
  write scope or `pull_request_target` gained). MCP server and hook entries
  carry a `config_sha256` over their full configuration; inside
  `env`/`headers` only values under secret-looking keys (shared sensitive-key
  vocabulary: token, secret, password, api_key, authorization, …) are redacted
  before hashing, so editing what an existing server or hook can do — args,
  commands, matchers, URL, key sets, or a grant-shaping value like
  `READ_ONLY=false` — is drift while credential rotation is not; the
  baseline's stored `inventory_sha256` is verified at load time and
  hand-edited or malformed baselines fail closed with exit 2. Advisory by default; `--fail-on-drift`
  exits 20 for scheduled CI gates — recipe at
  `examples/github-actions/12-host-grant-drift.yml`. Catches authority changes
  that land outside PR review, where the diff-time `SHIP-HOST-BOUNDARY-*`
  checks cannot see them.
- **`check` defers tool-surface changes to `verify` (coverage boundary).**
  `shipgate check` is boundary-scoped and does not compute the capability
  delta, so a clean boundary result over a diff that changes a
  manifest-declared `tool_sources[].path` no longer returns `allow` — it
  returns `decision="warn"` routing `first_next_action` to `verify`, with a
  `diagnostics[].code="capability_change_requires_verify"` marker and a
  `trace[].step="coverage"` event. Completion is still allowed, but `check`
  no longer green-lights a capability change only `verify` gates, so the local
  loop cannot disagree with `release_decision.decision`. Docs/test/boundary-only
  diffs are unaffected (still `allow`); no `agent_result_v1` schema change.
- **Agent-mode auto-detection.** Agent mode now auto-enables when a known
  coding-agent harness environment is detected (Claude Code exports
  `CLAUDECODE=1`, Cursor `CURSOR_TRACE_ID`), so structured `next_action`
  errors no longer require remembering `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_AGENT_MODE=1`. An
  explicit `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_AGENT_MODE=0` still forces it off.
- **Compact agent stdout for `verify`.** `verify --format agent` (new) prints
  the compact `agent_result_v1` payload (the same artifact written to
  `agents-shipgate-reports/agent-result.json`) on stdout, so one `verify`
  call closes the agent loop without a second file read. Bare `verify --json`
  resolves to this agent surface for verify runs (and to the full verifier
  JSON for `--preview`, whose relevance answer lives in the `trigger`
  block); `verify --format json` is unchanged. Inside a detected
  coding-agent environment, zero-flag `verify` defaults to the agent format.
- **Base auto-detection for `verify`.** When `--base` is omitted, verify
  auto-detects the default branch (`origin/HEAD`, `origin/main`,
  `origin/master`, `main`, `master`) and uses it for diff context — but only
  when the detected ref points at a different commit than the head, so a
  clean checkout of the default branch keeps today's working-tree behavior.
  The detection never fetches. `--no-base` disables it; an explicit `--base`
  always wins. The auto-detected ref is recorded in `base_notes`.
- **`init --claude-code` one-shot setup.** A single flag wires the full
  Claude Code surface: the `CLAUDE.md` managed block, the
  `.claude/skills/agents-shipgate/` skill bundle, the Claude Code hooks, and
  an `agents-shipgate verify --json` alias appended to Makefile /
  `package.json` scripts when those files exist. Idempotent, dry-run without
  `--write`, and reported under the additive `claude_code` key in
  `init --json` output.
- **Pre-commit hooks now run the verifier.** The `agents-shipgate` and
  `agents-shipgate-strict` pre-commit hook entries switch from unconditional
  `scan` to the trigger-gated `verify` flow (the `files:` regex pre-gate is
  unchanged), so local commits get the same merge-verdict surface as CI and
  diff-only trigger rules are evaluated once the hook fires.
- **`fix_task.patches[]`.** When `verify --suggest-patches` routes the repair
  to the coding agent, the fix task now carries the machine-applicable
  suggested patches (`{finding_id, check_id, patch}` with the discriminated
  set/append/remove-pointer payloads) so the agent gets concrete edits, not
  just prose instructions. Manual patches stay excluded and the field is
  additive — repair aid, never a gate input.
- **`fix_task` names low-confidence sources on `insufficient_evidence`.** The
  verify fix task for an `insufficient_evidence` verdict no longer dead-ends
  at the threshold sentence: it names each low-confidence source (count,
  source type, ref) with the explicit-inventory remedy and quotes up to
  three source warnings. Complements the report-layer
  `evidence_coverage.evidence_gaps[]` (schema v0.26); the route stays human
  because declaring an inventory asserts authority a coding agent must not
  invent. Deeper adapter-level config-bound toolkit detection is designed in
  `docs/engineering/config-bound-capability-detection.md`.
- **Claude Code adoption surfaces reworked.** The README gains a
  "Use with Claude Code" section, `docs/agents/use-with-claude-code.md` opens
  with the recommended one-command `init --claude-code` setup, and the
  `agents-shipgate` skill description triggers on change artifacts (MCP
  servers/tools, tool decorators, permission scopes, approval policies, agent
  CI) instead of product-name phrases only.
- **Cold-start dead ends now print an executable next action.** Human-mode
  CLI error paths surface the same ranked recovery step that agent mode
  emits as JSON: `scan`/`doctor`/`verify` config errors print a
  `next: …` / `why: …` hint (e.g. `next: agents-shipgate detect …` on a
  missing manifest), and the `init --write` → `scan` CHANGE_ME placeholder
  failure routes to the manifest edit instead of the generic missing-file
  advice — in both human and agent mode. `verify` also gains agent-mode
  structured errors (`AGENTS_SHIPGATE_AGENT_MODE=1`) and scan-parity
  flag-error vs run-error handling, so flag mistakes are never answered
  with manifest diagnostics. Hints are suppressed in agent mode to keep
  the `docs/errors.json` single-JSON-line contract. Driven by the
  2026-06-10 cold-start funnel test
  (`marketing/cold-start-funnel-test-2026-06-10.md`).

- Add the GTM plan of record (`marketing/gtm-strategy.md`), launch kit,
  design-partner outreach kit, and launch blog draft; README shows the
  verifier PR-comment verdict ("What your PR sees") and links the
  coding-agent install path from the quickstart.

- **Agent-native protocol.** `shipgate check --agent
  {codex,claude-code,cursor} --workspace . --format agent-json` is now the
  canonical one-command agent path. It returns the stable
  `agent_result_v1` contract with explicit completion, stop, repair,
  human-review, policy-provenance, source-artifact, and exit-code fields.
- **`agent_result_v1` policy provenance is required in 0.13.0 producers.**
  The schema name stays `agent_result_v1`; all in-tree producers now emit the
  required `policy` object plus `policy_snapshot_sha256`. Consumers validating
  older v0.12.0 objects should treat this as the 0.13.0 schema publication
  point and update together with the package version.
- **MCP server mode narrowed to `shipgate.check`.** The optional
  `[mcp]` server is now a read-only static adapter that accepts caller-provided
  diff text and returns exact `agent_result_v1`. The v0.12.0 preview tools
  (`shipgate_preview`, `shipgate_verify`, `shipgate_explain_finding`) were
  never listed in `STABILITY.md`; they are removed in favor of the single
  agent protocol command/tool.
- Policy weakening detection now compares parsed before/after policy YAML
  from reconstructed file content when available, so quoted scalars, inline
  comments, and hunks that omit the rule id still block.
- `shipgate check --head <ref>` or `--base <ref>` alone now fails closed with
  a structured CLI error. Provide both refs, or omit both to check local
  uncommitted changes.

## 0.12.0 - 2026-06-09

- **Actionable `insufficient_evidence` (report schema v0.26).**
  `release_decision.evidence_coverage.evidence_gaps[]` now lists one
  structured remediation row per low-confidence tool / source warning
  (`{kind, subject, source_type, source_ref, why, next_action}`), and scan
  writes an advisory `suggested-inventory.json` skeleton next to
  `report.json` whenever low-confidence tools exist — in the same
  MCP-export shape every `tool_inventories` manifest key loads. Pure
  projection of the existing coverage counts; thresholds, decisions, and
  fingerprints are unchanged.
- **Local capability-release ledger (`registry` v0.1).**
  `agents-shipgate registry ingest --attestation <file>` appends a
  normalized, content-addressed row to a JSONL ledger (idempotent);
  `registry query` filters by repo / verdict / capability id /
  trust-root flag. The v0 substrate for the cross-repo attestation
  registry; design boundary for any hosted aggregation documented in
  `docs/hosted-plane-design.md`, and the v1.0 report consolidation
  proposal in `docs/report-v1-consolidation-rc.md`.
- **Host capability governance v0 (`SHIP-HOST-BOUNDARY-*`).** New
  diff-aware, suppression-immune check family covering coding-agent host
  grants: MCP server additions/changes in `.mcp.json` /
  `.cursor/mcp.json` / `.vscode/mcp.json`, Claude Code
  `permissions.allow` expansion (wildcard-shaped rules like `Bash(*)`
  **block**; scoped expansions route to human review), `permissions.deny`
  removal, hook changes, GitHub workflow permission expansion
  (`write-all` blocks; read→write routes to review), and new
  `pull_request_target` triggers. Policy mirror at
  `policies/host-boundary.shipgate.yaml`; concepts and reviewer guidance
  in `docs/mcp-governance.md`. Trust-root classification now also covers
  `.claude/settings.json` / `.claude/settings.local.json` /
  `.cursor/mcp.json` / `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- **`audit --host` zero-config inventory.** One read-only command that
  answers "what is my coding agent currently allowed to do in this
  repo?" — MCP servers (env *keys* only, never values), permission rules
  with wildcard flags, hooks, and workflow write scopes /
  `pull_request_target` — as one page of Markdown or `--json`. Works
  without `shipgate.yaml`.
- **Policy packs v0.2: conditional composition + org distribution.**
  `match` gains `all_of` / `any_of` / `none_of` combinators (flat fields
  stay implicitly ANDed — fully backward compatible) and parameter
  predicates gain declared-bound comparisons (`maximum_above`,
  `minimum_below`), so rules like "financial action with amount unbounded
  or above 1000 must declare approval" are now declarative.
  `checks.policy_packs` entries accept an optional `sha256` content pin
  that fails the scan closed when a shared/org pack is tampered with.
  Schema frozen at `docs/policy-pack-schema.v0.2.json`.
- **MCP server mode (optional `[mcp]` extra).** `agents-shipgate
  mcp-serve` exposes `shipgate_preview`, `shipgate_verify`, and
  `shipgate_explain_finding` over stdio so shell-less agents can query
  the verifier in-loop. Pure projection layer: no network, no mutating
  tools, no second gate (`docs/mcp-server.md`).
- **PreToolUse boundary hook for Claude Code.** `install-hooks --target
  claude-code` now also registers a `PreToolUse` hook: editing a
  protected trust-root surface routes the tool call to the human
  (`permissionDecision: "ask"`, or `deny` via
  `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_PRETOOLUSE_DECISION`) with an explanation — the
  authority boundary surfaces in-session, before the edit, instead of at
  PR time. The protected-surface list is rendered at install time from
  the verify check's `TRUST_ROOT_SURFACES`, so hook and gate cannot
  drift.
- **Native GitHub Check Run support.** New Action inputs `check_run` /
  `check_run_name` publish the merge verdict as a Check Run
  (`mergeable` → success, `blocked` → failure, human-routed verdicts →
  neutral) with up to 50 line-level annotations from `report.sarif`
  (`scripts/github_check_run.py`; requires `checks: write`). New recipes:
  `examples/github-actions/09-risk-labels-and-reviewers.yml` (risk labels
  + trust-root reviewer routing from existing outputs) and
  `10-check-run-annotations.yml`.
- **`agent_weakens_gate` fixture.** One-command trust-root demo
  (`agents-shipgate fixture run agent_weakens_gate`): the head commit
  deletes the repo's Shipgate CI workflow — the cheapest reward-hack —
  and the verifier returns `merge_verdict: blocked` with
  `can_merge_without_human: false` via the suppression-immune
  `SHIP-VERIFY-CI-GATE-REMOVED` / `SHIP-CODEX-BOUNDARY-CI-GATE-REMOVED`
  checks.
- **Privacy hardening.** The redaction passthrough for already-redacted
  values now honors only marker kinds Shipgate itself emits, so scanned
  values formatted like `[REDACTED:...]` can no longer smuggle payloads
  past forced sensitive-key redaction. Added symlink-escape regression
  tests for input loading and `apply-patches` containment.
- Add a GitHub/verify `agent-result.json` artifact that uses the existing
  `agent_result_v1` schema instead of introducing a second agent-result
  contract. The Action exposes `agent_decision`, `risk_level`, `audit_id`,
  `required_reviewers`, and `policy_snapshot_sha256`, and the opt-in
  `fail_on_decisions` input now fails closed when configured but no compact
  agent decision is available.
- Phase 7 makes capability diff the default verifier review primitive when a
  reviewed base lock is committed: `verify` emits head capability locks plus
  semantic diff JSON/Markdown review artifacts when available, and attestation
  output moves from schema `0.1` to `0.2` to bind capability lock/diff hashes.
- SARIF results now prefer stable policy rule IDs when a finding carries one,
  while preserving the built-in Shipgate `check_id` in properties. Existing
  GitHub code-scanning alerts keyed by the previous rule ID may close/reopen
  on the first upgrade run.
- Add the repo's advisory self-dogfood Shipgate workflow, product-hardening
  gap-closure docs, Agent Workflow Evidence schemas, and the AgentPR Governance
  case catalog / acceptance spec.

## 0.11.0 - 2026-05-31

- **Verifier adoption-loop release prep.** Public docs and discovery metadata now
  lead with the verify-first adoption path, pinned `v0.11.0` snippets, verifier
  artifacts, merge verdicts, `fix_task`, and explicit Action merge-policy
  examples. Adds the verify-native `ai_generated_refund_pr` fixture for the
  blocked refund PR demo and introduces the provisional
  `agents-shipgate feedback export` command plus
  `docs/feedback-schema.v0.1.json` for redacted design-partner feedback loops.

- **Verifier PR comment v2 + additive Action outputs.** The GitHub Action now
  defaults to the verifier workflow (`verify_mode: verify`) and the
  capability-review PR comment (`pr_comment_style: capability-review`) for the
  next minor release. The comment starts from
  `release_decision.decision`, renders a top capability-change table, surfaces
  trust-root warnings, separates required human/coding-agent work, and links the
  generated artifacts. The v1 findings-oriented comment remains available for
  one minor release cycle with `pr_comment_style: findings`.
  - New Action outputs are additive:
    `should_run`, `trigger_action`, `trigger_rule_ids`, `verifier_verdict`,
    `trust_root_touched`, `policy_weakened`, `capability_changes_added`,
    `capability_changes_modified`, and `capability_changes_removed`.
  - Existing outputs are preserved; `decision` remains the preferred release
    gating output.
  - `verifier.json` now includes a derived `capability_review` projection
    over `report.capability_change` and `report.verifier_summary`. It is
    reviewer-facing only and cannot disagree with the head scan's
    `release_decision`.

- **New large-scale sample + asserted latency budget.**
  Adds `samples/large_multi_framework_agent/` — a production-shape retail-ops
  AI assistant with ~65 tools across five tool sources (payments OpenAPI,
  fulfillment OpenAPI, CRM MCP, internal warehouse MCP, OpenAI Agents SDK).
  Exercises the pipeline (loaders → checks → release decision → reports +
  packet + privacy redaction) at realistic load, well beyond the 5–15 tool
  range covered by the existing samples. The manifest declares *partial*
  governance coverage on purpose so the scan surfaces a realistic mix of
  blockers, review items, and audit-envelope activity (~10 critical
  approval gaps, ~70 review items, severity overrides, suppressions,
  manual risk hints).
  New `tests/test_large_sample.py` (12 cases) asserts:
  - **Latency budget of 10.0 s wall-clock per scan** (typical: 1–2 s on a
    2024 laptop). The release gate lives on the CI critical path; a
    silent regression that doubles scan time would be felt by every
    adopter. The budget is generous to absorb CI variance — if the
    typical time exceeds half the budget, the sample has grown or the
    pipeline has regressed.
  - **Structural shape**: all 5 sources contribute tools; tool count in
    [50, 100]; findings in [40, 200]; decision blocked; at least one
    critical `SHIP-POLICY-APPROVAL-MISSING`; scope-coverage fires;
    severity-override audit envelope populated; contribution rules
    exhaustive over findings; privacy/reviewer/heuristics audit
    envelopes emitted.
  No committed `expected/report.{md,json}` goldens (intentional — pinning
  50+ findings × 20+ report sections through every schema bump is high
  cost, low signal). Auto-discovered as `agents-shipgate fixture run
  large_multi_framework_agent`; NOT added to `self-check`'s default
  fixture set so install verification stays fast.

- **`init --write` now ensures `agents-shipgate-reports/` is gitignored.**
  Closes a long-standing DX gap: the reports directory created by the first
  `scan` would silently appear in `git status` (and could be committed by an
  agent running `git add -A`). On every `init --write` we now also write a
  managed block to `.gitignore`:
  - File missing → created with just the block.
  - File present without our markers and without an existing
    `agents-shipgate-reports/` line → managed block appended (separated by
    one blank line; user content preserved byte-for-byte).
  - File present with our markers → upserted (unchanged / updated / migrated
    on version bump; refused on a newer version).
  - File present with `agents-shipgate-reports/` (or `/agents-shipgate-reports`
    / `agents-shipgate-reports` / `/agents-shipgate-reports/`) already on its
    own line → no-op (`already_present`). Normalization mirrors what
    gitignore itself does: trailing whitespace is stripped (gitignore
    ignores it on patterns), but **leading whitespace is not** — a line
    like ` agents-shipgate-reports/` (one leading space) is a broken
    pattern that git does not honor, so we fall through and append our
    managed block. Mid-line `#` is *not* treated as a comment introducer
    (gitignore only treats line-leading `#` as a comment, so
    `agents-shipgate-reports/  # legacy line` is a literal pattern that
    matches nothing — we again fall through and append). The same
    leading-whitespace rule applies to `!`-negations:
    ` !agents-shipgate-reports/` is not honored by git, so we don't treat
    it as `skipped_negated` either.
  - File present with `!agents-shipgate-reports/` → no-op
    (`skipped_negated`). Explicit user opt-outs are respected.
  - File present with ambiguous markers (e.g. duplicate blocks) → no-op
    (`skipped_ambiguous`).
  Idempotent on both LF and CRLF hosts (CRLF is preserved when writing,
  and the marker regex tolerates a trailing `\r` so the second `init
  --write` recognizes the existing block rather than appending a
  duplicate). Also runs when the manifest already exists so
  repos that adopted Shipgate before this CLI version get the line on their
  next `init --write`. Failure modes (symlinked `.gitignore` chain, path is
  not a regular file, write error) emit an `error`/`skipped_*` outcome but
  never block `init` — exit code is unchanged from prior versions.

  The outcome is surfaced in `--json` output as a new
  `gitignore: {status, path, message, block_version}` field. A human-readable
  one-line message prints to stdout (or stderr for skip/error statuses);
  `unchanged` and `already_present` are quiet so the success path stays
  scannable. New module: `agents_shipgate.cli.discovery.gitignore_block`.
  New tests: `tests/test_init_gitignore.py` (48 cases covering pure
  parsing, upsert, variant detection, CRLF parse + two-run CRLF
  idempotency, mid-line-`#` no-stripping, leading-whitespace rejection
  (space + tab + on negations), trailing-whitespace acceptance, and
  end-to-end through the CLI).

- **MVP readiness polish.** Check metadata now carries public `mvp_tier`
  triage labels; the OpenAI Agents SDK static extractor can scan a directory of
  immediate `*.py` files; and CLI / GitHub summaries lead with the
  baseline-aware decision, headline, evidence coverage, and next action.
  - `mvp_tier` is metadata only. It does not affect check execution, severity,
    fingerprints, baselines, `release_decision`, or CI exit behavior.
  - OpenAI Agents SDK single-file and directory modes now both emit
    manifest-relative POSIX `source_ref` values. The extractor delegates to the
    shared Python static helper, so runtime/context parameters named `self`,
    `cls`, `ctx`, `context`, `config`, `runtime`, `run_manager`, or `callbacks`
    are omitted from normalized input schemas.
  - CLI top findings now show the highest-impact 3 active findings, prioritized
    by release blockers then review items. `list-checks` plain text includes
    `mvp_tier` as a third tab-separated column; use `--json` for stable
    programmatic consumption.

- **v0.21 — `--no-heuristics` CLI flag closes the round-3 / round-4 E5
  carryover.** `Finding.provenance_kind` has shipped on every report since
  v0.15 as required+non-nullable wire metadata but had no consumer for
  four review cycles. v0.21 lands the consumer the field was always
  designed for: a security/GRC-friendly filter that excludes findings
  whose provenance is `keyword_heuristic` or `regex_heuristic` from the
  active release-gating set.
  - New `--no-heuristics` flag on `agents-shipgate scan` (stable in
    0.x). When set, findings whose `provenance_kind` is in
    `NO_HEURISTICS_EXCLUDED_PROVENANCE_KINDS` (today: `keyword_heuristic`
    and `regex_heuristic`) are marked `suppressed=True` with
    `suppression_reason="filtered by --no-heuristics"` BEFORE the
    release decision is built. Filtered findings remain in `findings[]`
    for transparency; they no longer gate release. The KEEP list is
    `static_declaration`, `ast_extraction`, and `policy_pack` —
    declared/parsed-shape findings and explicit external rules stay in
    scope.
  - New top-level `report.heuristics_filter` audit envelope. Required +
    always present on emitted scans regardless of whether the flag was
    set (parallel to `privacy_audit` shape). Fields: `enabled`,
    `excluded_provenance_kinds: list[str]`, `filtered_finding_count`,
    `filtered_by_kind: dict[str, int]`. Earns the contract weight of
    `Finding.provenance_kind` by giving it a first-class consumer.
  - Manifest-driven suppression wins on overlap: a finding the user
    explicitly suppressed via `checks.ignore` keeps the user's reason
    text even when its provenance_kind would have triggered the
    filter. The audit envelope still counts the overlap so reviewers
    see the filter's effective scope.
  - `ReviewerSummary` lens/audit counts already reflect the post-filter
    active set (the filter runs before `build_reviewer_summary`); no
    new field added to `ReviewerSummary` — the dedicated envelope is
    the right audit home.
  - Schema bump: `report_schema_version: "0.20"` → `"0.21"`. v0.20 moves
    to frozen-reference; existing v0.20 consumers ignore the new field.
  - Contract-stamp pin in `docs/architecture.md` bumped to date
    `2026-05-23`, report `v0.21`, packet `v0.6` (unchanged). The
    `test_architecture_doc_contract_stamp_matches_runtime` regression
    test moves in lockstep.
  - 12 new tests in `tests/test_no_heuristics.py` covering: pure-
    function filter semantics (KEEP / FILTER classifications per
    provenance_kind), envelope shape parity across enabled=True/False,
    manifest-suppression preservation, contract-list completeness
    (every value in `NO_HEURISTICS_EXCLUDED_PROVENANCE_KINDS` is a
    real `ProvenanceKind`; KEEP+EXCLUDE partition is exact), end-to-
    end `run_scan(no_heuristics=True)`, CLI subprocess smoke test,
    monotone-non-increasing reviewer-summary lens counts under
    filtering.
  - **Decision recorded.** Round-4 review's E5 carryover offered ship-
    or-retire on `provenance_kind`. We ship. Retiring would have forced
    a deprecation cycle on a stable-contract field used by every
    report since v0.15; shipping the flag earns the weight and serves
    a real audience (security/GRC reviewers triaging declared-only
    findings before promotion).

- **v0.21 — CI coverage gate raised from 75% → 85% (E7 from round-4 review).**
  Both `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml` now
  pass `--cov-fail-under=85`. Aggregate coverage on `main` at the time of
  the bump is ~88%, so the gate is +10pp tighter with ~3pp headroom for
  day-to-day movement. The bump catches the next time a refactor lands
  materially less-covered code without corresponding tests. No source
  change required to land — the gate is simply closer to the actual
  signal. Per-file coverage is not enforced; the aggregate floor only
  rises in step with what's already proven on `main`.

- **v0.21 — decompose `inputs/n8n.py` into `inputs/n8n/` package (E8 from
  round-3 review).** The largest input adapter (1493 lines monolithic)
  is now a 6-module package with per-concern boundaries; the public
  surface (`N8nAdapter`, `load_n8n_artifacts`) is unchanged via
  `__init__.py` re-exports. No behavior change — all 30 `tests/test_n8n.py`
  cases pass byte-identical; M3 trust-lint passes; M5 plugin validation
  passes; adapter-discovery contract test (PR #111) passes.
  - `_common.py` (300 LOC) — constants (`N8N_NODE_TYPE_RE`,
    `FROM_AI_RE`, `N8N_SOURCE_TYPES`, `BUILTIN_N8N_PREFIXES`,
    `HTTP_METHODS`), `_NodeItem` and `_Edge` data classes, leaf string
    / path / hash / redaction helpers, node-kind classification.
  - `_secrets.py` (122 LOC) — secret scanning of parameters / notes /
    `pinData` / `staticData` against the v0.19 global `SECRET_PATTERNS`
    layer.
  - `_auth_risk.py` (148 LOC) — credential references, `AuthInfo`
    synthesis, risk-hint heuristics, HTTP path hint.
  - `_tools.py` (492 LOC) — Tool extraction for the 5 flavours (ai,
    workflow, code, http, mcp_client) + projected `mcp`, schema
    extraction (`$fromAI(...)` macro, `inputSchema`, `outputSchema`,
    `parameters.fields`), MCP Client Tool selection mode, tool-artifact
    recording.
  - `_workflows.py` (464 LOC) — workflow file loading, shape detection,
    `_extract_workflow` orchestrator, connection-graph edges, node-record
    builders, dynamic-surface emission.
  - `_adapter.py` (249 LOC) — `N8nAdapter`, `load_n8n_artifacts`, and
    auxiliary loaders (`_load_inventory_ref`, `_load_credential_stubs`,
    `_load_structured_refs`, `_artifact_paths`, `_credential_entries`).
  - Dependency direction is a DAG at module-load time:
    `_common ← _secrets, _auth_risk ← _tools ← _workflows ← _adapter`.
    `_tools` calls back into `_workflows` for record builders and
    dynamic-surface emission via late imports inside the call sites
    that need them — keeps the static import graph one-way.
  - `tests/test_public_surface_contract.py::test_supported_inputs_match_adapter_class_vars_bidirectionally`
    updated from `glob("*.py")` to `rglob("*.py")` so adapter
    sub-packages are scanned (the contract test was written when n8n
    was a single file).
  - Closes round-3 evolution item E8; brings the largest input adapter
    in line with the typical adapter file size (mcp.py 148, openapi.py
    343, langchain.py 305). Largest sub-module now is `_tools.py` at
    492 LOC.

- **Adoption kit rendering externalized.** Codex and Claude Code
  `--agent-instructions` skill bundles now render from packaged
  `adoption-kits/` files instead of Python string constants. Downstream repos
  can provide `.agents-shipgate/adoption-kit.yaml` or
  `--agent-instructions-kit <path>` for local overrides, and generated skill
  directories now carry `.agents-shipgate-kit.json` sidecars for managed
  migrations.

- **v0.20 — third-party adapter entry-point discovery (E4 from round-3 review).**
  Opens the same extension surface for adapters (input loaders) that M5
  already opened for check plugins. Discovery is gated by the existing
  `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_ENABLE_PLUGINS=1` env var and `--no-plugins` CLI flag.
  - New entry-point group: `agents_shipgate.adapters`. A third-party
    package declares an adapter class (or instance) in its
    `pyproject.toml` under
    `[project.entry-points."agents_shipgate.adapters"]`; the class must
    satisfy the `ToolSourceAdapter` Protocol — `source_type` ClassVar,
    `scope` ClassVar (`per_source` or `per_scan`), `artifact_class`
    ClassVar, and a `load(source, base_dir, manifest)` method.
  - New module `src/agents_shipgate/inputs/adapter_validation.py` with
    four load-time gates: `load_failed`, `bad_protocol`, `bad_scope`,
    and **`source_type_collision`** — the load-bearing trust rule
    rejecting any third-party adapter whose `source_type` shadows a
    built-in or another already-registered third-party adapter.
  - New top-level `discover_third_party_adapters(registry, *,
    plugins_enabled, loaded_adapters)` in `inputs/protocol.py` walks
    `entry_points("agents_shipgate.adapters")`, validates each entry,
    and registers the valid ones onto the supplied registry. Both
    valid and invalid records surface in
    `report.loaded_adapters[]` so reviewers can see what was skipped.
  - New report field `loaded_adapters: list[dict[str, Any]]` parallel
    to `loaded_plugins[]`. Items carry `name`, `value`, `distribution`,
    `version`, `source_type`, `validation_status`,
    `validation_errors[]`, `runtime_errors[]`. Required + present on
    every emitted scan (empty list when `--no-plugins` or no
    third-party adapters are installed). The schema generator marks
    each item's eight fields as required.
  - `--strict-plugins` (v0.17+) extended to cover adapter failures.
    Any non-`valid` `loaded_adapters[]` row OR non-empty
    `loaded_adapters[].runtime_errors` now elevates the scan to exit
    code 4 alongside the existing plugin failures.
  - `--no-plugins` flag help text updated to mention third-party
    adapter discovery is also disabled.
  - `run_validated_adapter` (in `adapter_validation.py`) provides a
    runtime safety wrapper for callers that want to capture
    exceptions into `loaded_adapters[].runtime_errors` instead of
    propagating them. The dispatcher's existing `_absorb` artifact-
    class check already fires `TypeError` for artifact smuggling;
    runtime wrapping is opt-in for future adapter-execution paths.
  - 21 new tests in `tests/test_adapter_entry_point_discovery.py`:
    each of the four gates + valid-class + valid-instance + env-var
    gating + `--no-plugins` overrides + collision-with-each-builtin
    parametrize + collision-between-third-parties + `--strict-plugins`
    end-to-end + runtime safety net (exception capture, wrong return
    type, artifact smuggling).
  - STABILITY.md gains a new "Third-party adapter discovery (v0.20+)"
    subsection under "Trust-model invariants" documenting the four
    gates + the `source_type_collision` load-bearing rule.

- **v0.20 — top-level `reviewer_summary` block.** Adds a deterministic
  projection of the reviewer lens surfaces (`tool_surface_diff`,
  capability/intent diff, `action_surface_diff`, evidence matrix) and
  audit envelopes (`policy_audit`, `privacy_audit`, baseline integrity
  findings). Parallels v0.12's `agent_summary` for the reviewer side:
  `agent_summary` answers "what should an agent do next?" and
  `reviewer_summary` answers "what should a reviewer look at first?".
  - Schema: bumped `report_schema_version` 0.19 → 0.20. The new block
    is required + non-nullable on the wire (Pydantic-Optional only for
    legacy test helpers). v0.19 schema is preserved at
    `docs/report-schema.v0.19.json`.
  - Fields: `verdict` (mirrors `release_decision.decision`), `headline`
    (≤200 chars, PR-comment-friendly), per-lens activity counts
    (`tool_surface_changes`, `capability_misalignments`,
    `action_surface_changes`, `evidence_matrix_gaps`), per-audit
    counts (`severity_overrides_applied`,
    `severity_overrides_tier_crossed`, `privacy_redactions`,
    `baseline_integrity_issues`), and `first_recommended_surface`
    (deterministic pointer or `null` on a clean scan).
  - `first_recommended_surface` priority: blocked → release_decision,
    insufficient_evidence → release_decision, then action_surface_diff
    > baseline_integrity > tier-crossed policy_audit >
    capability_intent_diff > tool_surface_diff > privacy_audit >
    evidence_matrix > null. Encoded in `_pick_first_recommended_surface`
    and pinned by `test_reviewer_summary.py`.
  - Projection invariants: pure (no I/O, no LLM calls), deterministic
    (same inputs → byte-identical output, asserted by
    `test_build_reviewer_summary_is_deterministic`), cannot disagree
    with the underlying lens/audit data.
  - STABILITY.md + docs/agent-contract-current.md: new bullets +
    enum-additivity rule mirroring `agent_summary.verdict`.

- **Docs: refresh `docs/architecture.md` to v0.19 reality.** The doc
  was stuck at pre-v0.6 conceptually — it described `core/models.py`
  as the shared model home (deleted in PR #95), framed adapters as
  free-function `load_<name>_artifacts(...)` (pre-v0.11 pattern), and
  did not mention the `schemas/` layer, the five reviewer lenses
  (tool surface / capability-intent / action surface / policy audit
  / evidence matrix), the three audit envelopes (policy audit,
  privacy audit, baseline audit log), the AST trust lint, plugin
  validation gates, severity-override floor, baseline integrity, or
  the privacy redaction layer. Refresh covers the v0.19 pipeline
  end-to-end, names every module, cross-links to `STABILITY.md` for
  each contract, and pins exit code `6` (strict `baseline verify`
  failure). No code change.

- **v0.18 / PR #1 trust-hardening: `dynamic_default` contract in
  `CheckMetadata`.** Formalizes the M1 dynamic-severity contract closed
  in v0.17.
  - `CheckMetadata.dynamic_default: bool = False` opts a check into the
    swing-severity category — its emitted finding severity depends on
    user-declared manifest values rather than the static catalog
    default. The severity-override resolver must receive the
    manifest-effective default via `extra_known_check_defaults`;
    otherwise tier-crossing comparison runs against the static catalog
    default and an aggressive override can silently bypass the gate.
  - A new model validator rejects `dynamic_default=True` without
    `floor_severity` — a swing check without a floor has no safety net.
  - `SHIP-ACTION-POLICY-VIOLATION` now declares `dynamic_default=True`
    and `floor_severity="medium"`. Two distinct contracts apply to
    existing manifests; both produce loud `ConfigError` (exit 2):
    - **Hard floor (no bypass).** Manifests resolving the check below
      `medium` — i.e., to `low` or `info` — are rejected by the
      `floor_severity` validator. `acknowledge_overrides` does NOT
      bypass the floor; the only remedies are to raise the override to
      `medium` or above, or remove the override entirely.
    - **Tier-crossing requires ack.** Downgrading from the catalog
      default `high` to the floor `medium` crosses the high → normal
      tier boundary. This case is allowed only with an
      `acknowledge_overrides` entry that supplies a reason; without one
      it is rejected with a tier-boundary error (not a floor error).
    Manifests currently overriding `SHIP-ACTION-POLICY-VIOLATION` to
    `low`/`info` cannot fix the regression by adding an ack — they must
    raise the override severity. Manifests overriding to `medium`
    without an ack pass once the ack is added.
  - `cli/scan.py:_dynamic_check_defaults` is the new canonical
    aggregator. It seeds every catalog check carrying
    `dynamic_default=True` with its static default (step 1), overlays
    manifest-effective values for action-surface policies (step 2), and
    adds policy-pack rule IDs (step 3). The seed loop guarantees the
    resolver's internal-consistency guard cannot false-positive on user
    input that overrides a swing check without declaring the
    corresponding manifest section.
  - A contract test `test_dynamic_default_aggregator_completeness`
    fails the moment someone adds a new `dynamic_default=True` catalog
    entry without ensuring the aggregator covers it.
  - Future checks emitting at manifest-declared severity must (A) set
    `dynamic_default=True` in `CHECK_METADATA` and (B) add an aggregator
    overlay branch in `cli/scan.py:_dynamic_check_defaults`. The
    contract test enforces both.
- **v0.18 / PR #1 plugin gate: `dynamic_default_not_supported`.**
  - New plugin-validation status rejects plugins declaring
    `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_METADATA.dynamic_default=True`. Plugins have no
    path into the scan dispatcher's aggregator and so could never
    receive the manifest-effective default needed for tier-crossing
    comparison; emitting at that severity directly is the supported
    path (with the floor contract still applying via
    `CheckMetadata.floor_severity`).
  - The gate runs **before** `_coerce_metadata()` so a plugin declaring
    `dynamic_default=True` without `floor_severity` lands in
    `dynamic_default_not_supported` rather than being mis-classified
    as `bad_floor` by the new `CheckMetadata` model validator.
- **v0.18 / PR #2 review follow-up: per-call-site allowlist pinning.**
  PR #91 review caught two structural holes in the v0.18 trust lint
  extension:
  - **P1**: the allowlist matched on `(relative_path, surface)` only,
    so one entry blanket-permitted every occurrence of a surface in
    a file. A future unreviewed `subprocess.run(...)` added to an
    already-allowlisted file would slip past silently.
  - **P2**: `importlib.resources` was globally exempted, so
    `files(name)` calls produced no violation. The current uses
    pass a literal `'agents_shipgate'` anchor, but a future
    user-controlled anchor would bypass the dynamic-import lint.

  Both are closed by tightening the allowlist contract:
  - `AllowedException` now carries `line: int` and `snippet: str`
    (canonical `ast.unparse` of the offending node) in addition to
    `relative_path` and `surface`. `_violation_allowed` matches on
    all four fields. Adding a new `subprocess.run` call to an
    already-allowlisted file now requires a new entry; changing an
    existing call's argv shape changes the `snippet` and fails the
    contract test.
  - `importlib.resources.` joins `FORBIDDEN_ATTR_CALL_PREFIXES`, and
    `importlib.resources` joins `TRACKED_NON_FORBIDDEN_MODULES`. The
    earlier draft of this PR only forbade `importlib.resources.files`,
    which left `read_text`, `read_binary`, `path`, `open_text`,
    `open_binary`, `is_resource`, `contents`, `as_file`, and any
    future addition under the module as a parallel bypass — each
    takes the same anchor-package argument and would have been
    silently allowed. The prefix entry catches the whole family.
    `from importlib.resources import <attr>; <attr>(...)` and
    `import importlib.resources as res; res.<attr>(...)` both
    resolve to canonical `importlib.resources.<attr>` and trip the
    prefix. Both first-party call sites in `triggers.py` and
    `fixtures.py` (currently `files`-only) are individually pinned
    with the literal `'agents_shipgate'` anchor in the snippet — a
    future `files(some_user_anchor)` or `read_text(some_user_anchor,
    ...)` call would change the snippet and fail the test.
  - `Violation` gains `snippet: str` captured via `ast.unparse(node)`.
  - New regression test
    `test_allowed_exceptions_pin_subprocess_run_per_call_site`
    asserts that multi-call files (triggers.py, artifacts.py) have
    distinct entries per call site, so the P1 bypass cannot
    reappear via consolidation.
  - New regression test `test_allowed_exceptions_have_no_duplicates`
    asserts no two entries cover the same call site.
  - Negative-control: injecting a 4th `subprocess.run` into
    `triggers.py` now fails the contract test with the precise
    `(line, surface, snippet)` triple. Injecting
    `files(user_var)` in place of `files('agents_shipgate')` fails
    similarly.

- **v0.18 / PR #2 trust-hardening: static AST lint widened to entire scanner.**
  Previously `tests/test_adapter_static_only.py` AST-scanned only
  `src/agents_shipgate/inputs/`; the public claim in STABILITY.md and
  README is broader ("the scanner does not execute or import user code").
  The lint now structurally enforces the broader claim.
  - Scope widened: scanner now walks every `.py` file under
    `src/agents_shipgate/` via `rglob`. The legacy
    `test_invariant_lint_covers_every_adapter_module` was paranoid for
    the 18-file `inputs/` case and no longer scales to ~80 files — the
    new contract test
    `test_no_unallowlisted_forbidden_surface_in_scanner` is the
    replacement, asserting a definitive PASS/FAIL signal over the whole
    sweep.
  - Four legitimate first-party meta-CLI surfaces are allowlisted via a
    new `ALLOWED_EXCEPTIONS` tuple of `AllowedException` entries, each
    with prose rationale:
    - `cli/bootstrap.py` `subprocess.run(...)` — chains
      `detect → init → scan → apply-patches` against Shipgate's own CLI.
    - `cli/discovery/artifacts.py` `subprocess.run(["git", ...])` —
      probes the user repo for file inventory.
    - `triggers.py` `subprocess.run(["git", "diff", ...])` — trigger
      evaluation reads diff content.
    - `cli/self_check.py` `__import__(name)` — validates that supplied
      modules are installed. Runs only under
      `agents-shipgate self-check`.
  - Two contract tests prevent allowlist rot:
    `test_allowlist_entry_matches_real_surface` (every entry must
    correspond to a real surface) and
    `test_no_unallowlisted_forbidden_surface_in_scanner` (every forbidden
    surface must be allowlisted or eliminated).
  - `importlib.resources` added to `ALLOWED_FORBIDDEN_MODULE_IMPORTS`
    for bundled-package files (e.g. `fixtures.py`, `triggers.py`).
    `importlib.metadata` remains allowed for plugin/adapter discovery.
  - `_scan_source` now returns structured `Violation` objects
    (`line`, `surface`, `message`) instead of preformatted strings, so
    callers can route by `surface` against `ALLOWED_EXCEPTIONS`.
  - STABILITY.md "Trust-model invariants" widened to cite the entire
    scanner package and adds a "Meta-CLI surfaces (allowlisted,
    audited)" subsection documenting each of the four entries.

- **v0.17 / M1 trust-hardening: severity-override floor + audit.**
  - `core.models.CheckMetadata` gains an optional `floor_severity` field
    (Severity | None). 16 release-critical built-in checks now declare a
    hard floor:
    - `SHIP-POLICY-APPROVAL-MISSING` (critical → floor "high")
    - `SHIP-ACTION-{FINANCIAL-WRITE-CONTROL-MISSING, DESTRUCTIVE-ROLLBACK-MISSING,
      WILDCARD-SCOPE, EFFECT-ESCALATED, APPROVAL-REMOVED}` (critical → floor "high")
    - `SHIP-AUTH-{MISSING-SCOPE, MANIFEST-BROAD-SCOPE, TOOL-BROAD-SCOPE,
      SCOPE-COVERAGE-MISSING}` (high → floor "medium")
    - `SHIP-SCOPE-{TOOL-OUTSIDE-PURPOSE, PROHIBITED-TOOL-PRESENT}` (high → floor "medium")
    - `SHIP-INVENTORY-{WILDCARD-TOOLS, LOW-CONFIDENCE-PRODUCTION-SURFACE}` (high → floor "medium")
    - `SHIP-POLICY-CONFIRMATION-MISSING` (high → floor "medium")
    - `SHIP-SIDEFX-IDEMPOTENCY-MISSING` (high → floor "medium")
  - Any `checks.severity_overrides` entry that resolves below the floor
    is rejected as a manifest config error (exit 2). The floor is hard;
    no acknowledgement bypasses it. **Breaking** for manifests that
    previously downgraded these checks below their new floor — fix by
    raising the override to floor-or-above, or removing the override.
  - `checks.severity_overrides` accepts both the legacy scalar form
    (`SHIP-XYZ: medium`) and a new rich form
    (`SHIP-XYZ: { severity, reason, expires }`). Reason flows into the
    new audit row; expires gives reviewers a time-bounded override.
  - New `checks.acknowledge_overrides[]` block. Required for any
    severity override whose application crosses a severity tier
    boundary (critical ↔ high, high ↔ medium/low/info) as a downgrade.
    Tier-crossing **upgrades** never require ack (strictly more
    conservative). Same-tier downgrades (medium → low) don't require ack.
    For checks emitted with manifest-declared severity (action-surface
    policies via `SHIP-ACTION-POLICY-VIOLATION`, policy-pack rules)
    the resolver compares against the strongest declared severity
    across the manifest, not the static catalog default — so a
    `severity: critical` action policy with override `high` is
    correctly tier-crossing and requires ack.
  - Expired `acknowledge_overrides` entry raises a manifest config error
    (exit 2) — no advisory-mode bypass. Same hard contract applies to
    `expires` on rich-form `severity_overrides` entries.
  - New top-level `report.policy_audit` block surfacing every applied
    override:
    `policy_audit.severity_overrides_applied[].{check_id,
    default_severity, applied_severity, manifest_path, reason,
    tier_crossed, direction, expires}`. Always emitted on scans (empty
    envelope when no overrides applied); required + non-nullable on
    the wire (mirrors the v0.12 `agent_summary` pattern). Lands at
    `report_schema_version: "0.17"` alongside M8's
    `release_decision.contribution_rules[]` — both audits are additive
    and share the same schema bump.
  - Markdown report renders a new "Policy Audit" section between
    Release Decision and Summary when overrides exist. GitHub step
    summary adds a one-liner counting overrides + tier-crossed +
    upgrades/downgrades.
  - New module `core/severity_overrides.py` owns floor/tier/ack/expiry
    resolution as a pure function; `core/findings.py::apply_severity_overrides`
    still consumes a flat `dict[str, Severity]` so existing direct
    callers and tests stay byte-compatible.
  - `AgentsShipgateManifest.severity_overrides()` still returns the
    flat scalar projection for back-compat; new
    `severity_override_entries()` returns the rich shape and
    `acknowledge_overrides()` returns the ack list.
- Added `release_decision.contribution_rules[]` — a deterministic
  per-finding audit of how each finding contributed to the release
  decision (M8 of the Trust Hardening Pass). Bumps
  `report_schema_version` to `0.17` (shared with M1's `policy_audit`).
  Exactly one row per `report.findings` entry (including suppressed)
  with `category` ∈ `{blocker, review_item, excluded}` and `rule` ∈
  `{policy_block_new, severity_block_new, policy_baseline_accepted,
  severity_baseline_accepted, review_required, sub_threshold,
  suppressed}`. The new `STABILITY.md` "Release decision truth table"
  documents which `(rule, category)` pair fires for every
  `(blocks_release, severity, baseline_status, fail_on)` combination.
  Additive only: no semantic change to `decision`, `blockers[]`,
  `review_items[]`, `fail_policy.exit_code`, or strict-mode exit codes —
  the audit reflects existing behavior, it does not modify it. The
  field defaults to `[]` for legacy reports loaded via
  `explain-finding` so consumers never need an existence check.
- Replaced the hardcoded `if/elif` source-dispatch in `cli/scan.py` with a
  real `ToolSourceAdapter` Protocol and `AdapterRegistry`. Every loader
  (MCP, OpenAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, LangChain, CrewAI, n8n,
  Codex plugin, OpenAI API, Anthropic API) is now an adapter class that
  registers with `agents_shipgate.inputs.protocol.REGISTRY`. The scan
  pipeline returns a typed `ArtifactBag` so framework artifacts retain
  their concrete types into `ScanContext`. Framework adapters now fire
  correctly when configured via top-level manifest sections without a
  matching `tool_sources` entry. Internal refactor — no behavior change
  for users.
- Added minimal source provenance to findings. `agents-shipgate scan` now
  emits `report_schema_version: "0.11"` with optional structured location
  keys on `findings[].source`: `path`, `start_line`, `end_line`,
  `start_column`, and `pointer` (RFC 6901). Populated for the common
  tool-source loaders (OpenAPI, MCP, OpenAI tool artifacts, Anthropic
  tool artifacts) when the source file is YAML; JSON inputs carry `path`
  and `pointer` but no line. SARIF emits the position via
  `physicalLocation.region.startLine` (and `endLine` / `startColumn`
  when present), with the JSON pointer under
  `properties.shipgatePointer`. Capability-Intent Diff markdown appends
  `(at path:line)` to misalignment rows when provenance is available.
  `run_id` explicitly excludes the new provenance fields so YAML line
  drift cannot churn the hash. Reports without populated provenance
  remain byte-identical to v0.10 because `report_json_payload` strips
  unset keys.
- Added JSON-first tool-surface diff for PR review. `agents-shipgate scan`
  now emits `report_schema_version: "0.10"` with always-present
  `tool_surface_facts` and `tool_surface_diff` fields. The diff explains
  added/removed/changed tools, high-risk tag changes, scope drift, enforcement
  control changes, policy drift, finding deltas, and accepted debt without
  changing `release_decision.decision`, strict/advisory exit behavior, or SARIF.
- Added `agents-shipgate scan --diff-from <path>` for comparing against a prior
  `report.json` or v0.3 baseline JSON. `--baseline` still controls finding
  baseline status and strict-mode filtering; `--diff-from` controls only
  `tool_surface_diff`.
- Baseline files now save as schema `0.3` with optional `tool_surface_facts`.
  Schema `0.2` baselines continue to load for accepted-debt matching but cannot
  enable surface diff by themselves.
- GitHub Action adds `diff_from`, `diff_base`, and `diff_enabled`. Setting
  `diff_base: target` performs a best-effort target-branch scan with the
  PR-side installed package and falls back to a disabled diff note on fetch,
  config, schema, or scan failures.
- Release Evidence Packet schema bumped to `0.2` with a compact
  `tool_surface_diff` section derived from the report JSON.
- Added optional manifest-level HITL validation evidence mode under
  `validation:`. The scanner now reads local approval traces, override logs,
  high-risk auto-approval exclusions, and promotion criteria to structure
  evidence gaps for reviewers; it does not generate those runtime artifacts or
  certify readiness.
- Tightened HITL evidence wording and provenance. `SHIP-EVIDENCE-*` findings
  now describe missing or incomplete local review evidence without implying
  runtime controls are absent, and include deterministic
  `evidence.source_provenance[]` entries. `source_provenance` is excluded from
  finding fingerprints, so adding provenance does not rotate existing HITL
  baselines or suppressions.
- Release Evidence Packet schema bumped to `0.3` with
  `human_in_the_loop.runtime_control_disclaimer`,
  `human_in_the_loop.source_provenance[]`, and
  `human_in_the_loop.provenance_mode`.
- Added `samples/hitl_evidence_covered_agent`, a refund-domain fixture with
  local approval trace, override log, high-risk exclusion, and promotion
  criteria evidence.
- Added four `SHIP-EVIDENCE-*` checks. Existing baselines may surface these as
  new findings after upgrade when a manifest opts into `validation:`.
- Add `agents-shipgate scenario suggest` (target: `0.9.1`), a YAML export that
  fans out `report.json.suggested_scenarios[]` into concrete
  per-finding/per-tool dynamic validation steps.
- Added ranked next-action diagnostics: `detect --json` and `doctor --json`
  now emit `diagnostics: [...]` and `next_actions: [...]` blocks alongside
  the existing single-string `next_action` field. Coding-agent callers can
  recover from common first-run failures (missing manifest, zero tools,
  unresolved `CHANGE_ME`, missing source files, MCP/OpenAPI artifact-only
  workspaces, dynamic toolsets, production targets without permissions, and
  three negative-control cases) without consulting human-facing docs. Errors
  emitted under `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_AGENT_MODE=1` carry the same `next_actions`
  array. Diagnostic catalog and schema in [docs/diagnostics.md](docs/diagnostics.md).
- Behavior change: when a required `tool_sources[].path` does not
  resolve (file missing OR resolves outside the manifest directory),
  `agents-shipgate doctor --json` exits **0** with
  `unresolved_sources: [...]` and a `SHIP-DIAG-MISSING-SOURCE-FILE`
  diagnostic so an agent gets a routable next action. The non-JSON
  `agents-shipgate doctor` form prints the same diagnostic in
  human-readable form and exits **3** so interactive users still see a
  loud failure. `agents-shipgate scan` is unchanged — it still raises
  `InputParseError(3)` on the same condition regardless of `--json`.
- `DetectResult` gains a `workspace_signals` block (Python file count,
  `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt` presence, conventional dir hits) used
  by the new diagnostic resolvers to discriminate negative-control cases.
  The block is additive; existing fields are unchanged.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-05-05

- Report schema bumped to `v0.8`. New top-level required `release_decision` block:
  `{decision, reason, blockers, review_items, evidence_coverage, baseline_delta, fail_policy}`.
  - `decision` is one of `"blocked" | "review_required" | "passed"` and is the
    recommended release-gate signal for v0.8+ consumers.
  - `blockers` and `review_items` are reference-only entries
    (`id, fingerprint, check_id, severity, title, baseline_status`) — full
    Finding payloads stay in `findings[]`.
  - `release_decision` is **baseline-aware**: matched criticals appear in
    `review_items` (accepted debt), not `blockers`. Critical severity is
    **policy-independent** — even advisory CI surfaces a new critical as a
    blocker (with `would_fail_ci=false`).
  - `release_decision.fail_policy.exit_code` matches the process exit code
    one-for-one across all `ci_mode` × `fail_on` × `--baseline` combinations.
- `summary.status` is preserved byte-for-byte for backwards compatibility
  with v0.7 consumers. It stays baseline-blind (a baseline-matched critical
  still flips status to `release_blockers_detected`). The intentional
  divergence from `release_decision.decision` is documented in
  [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md#release_decisiondecision-vs-summarystatus).
- `docs/report-schema.v0.8.json` added; `v0.7.json` retained as a frozen
  reference. JSON-schema validation catches missing `release_decision` on
  any emitted report.
- Markdown / GitHub Action / CLI summaries now lead with the Release
  Decision block (Decision → Reason → Blockers → Review items → Evidence
  coverage → Baseline delta → Fail policy). SARIF output is unchanged.
- GitHub Action exposes four new outputs: `decision`, `blocker_count`,
  `review_item_count`, `ci_would_fail`. Existing outputs (`status`,
  `critical_count`, `baseline_*`, `adk_*`, `report_*`, `exit_code`)
  unchanged.
- The release verdict path remains deterministic and LLM-free: no agent
  execution, tool call, model call, MCP connection, network access, or
  telemetry is added for v0.8.
- `exit_code_for_report()` refactored to share `effective_fail_on()` and
  `baseline_filtered_active()` helpers with `build_release_decision()`,
  so the standalone exit code and `release_decision.fail_policy.exit_code`
  cannot drift. New regression test pins this across the matrix.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-05-01

Adoption activation: makes the v0.6 features visible to humans and AI
coding agents on real repos, plus exposes per-check remediation
metadata so agents can route findings without re-walking the catalog.

- Agent-facing docs surface:
  - New "Should I run Shipgate on this PR?" trigger table in
    `AGENTS.md` with the soft-stop rule (don't skip MCP/OpenAPI-only
    repos that surface as `is_agent_project: false`).
  - New `docs/agent-recipes.md` — copy-pasteable AI-agent workflows
    for the canonical 4-call flow.
  - New `docs/autofix-policy.md` — four classes (safe / medium /
    manual / never), catalog-vs-Finding contract, strict derivation
    rule, three patch states, unknown-check-id fallback,
    `apply-patches --confidence` table, decision tree.
  - New `docs/minimal-real-configs.md` — per-framework references to
    runnable `samples/*` fixtures (no inline snippets to drift).
  - `docs/INDEX.md` cleanup: stale `report-schema.v0.5.json` link
    removed; current schema link now `report-schema.v0.7.json`.
  - `docs/quickstart.md` adds a "second 60 seconds" real-repo path.
- `CheckMetadata` extensions:
  - New `autofix_safe`, `requires_human_review`, `suggested_patch_kind`
    fields on every check (45 entries). `docs_url` populated for every
    check pointing at a stable `### SHIP-...` anchor in
    `docs/checks.md`. 7 new per-check sections added to `docs/checks.md`
    so every check has a stable anchor.
  - Catalog-level safety bools stay conservative — even checks whose
    generator usually produces a safe non-manual patch (stale-manifest
    removals, scope coverage) keep `autofix_safe: false` /
    `requires_human_review: true` because the generator can fall back
    to `ManualPatch` in edge cases (ambiguous duplicates, etc.).
    `suggested_patch_kind` is informational — describes what the
    generator targets when conditions are clean.
- `Finding` extensions + derivation:
  - Same four optional fields on every Finding, populated by
    `annotate_remediation` during scan. Three patch states handled
    distinctly:
    - `patches: None` (no `--suggest-patches`) → seed from
      CheckMetadata; safe-closed fallback for unknown check IDs
      (policy packs, third-party plugins).
    - `patches: []` (--suggest-patches ran but generator emitted
      nothing) → safe-closed shape with `suggested_patch_kind: "none"`.
      Does NOT fall back to catalog (the report carries no patches).
    - `patches: [...]` (non-empty) → strict derivation rule:
      `autofix_safe: true` ONLY when EVERY emitted patch is non-manual
      AND high-confidence. Mixed states fall to safe-closed.
  - `docs_url` always sourced from CheckMetadata (patches don't carry
    per-instance documentation URLs).
- Report schema bumped to `v0.7` per
  [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md#stability-contract) ("`report_schema_version`
  bumps minor on additive changes"). `docs/report-schema.v0.7.json`
  added; `v0.6.json` retained as a frozen reference.
- `_run_id` excludes the four new derived fields plus `patches` so
  toggling `--suggest-patches` (or future enrichment fields) doesn't
  shift the hash. New regression test pins this.
- Plugin-loading isolation: every code path that reads the catalog
  during scan honors the scan's `plugins_enabled` setting, including
  the `_attach_patches` recommendation lookup.
  `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_ENABLE_PLUGINS=1 agents-shipgate scan --no-plugins`
  no longer loads plugins.
- Onboarding prompt rewrite: `prompts/add-shipgate-to-repo.md` now
  leads with the canonical 4-call flow (`detect → init --write --ci →
  scan --suggest-patches → apply-patches --json`) and includes the
  decision tree from `docs/autofix-policy.md`. Soft-stop rule
  documented inline. `apply-patches --json` flag added so the
  reporting step has structured data to read.
- Dual-copy prompt parity: byte-identical mirror between
  `prompts/` and `skills/agents-shipgate/prompts/` enforced by
  `tests/test_prompt_parity.py` so the two surfaces can't drift.
- Test coverage: 314 tests pass. New test files:
  `tests/test_remediation_metadata.py`,
  `tests/test_finding_remediation.py`,
  `tests/test_docs_links.py`,
  `tests/test_prompt_parity.py`,
  `tests/test_v07_metadata_roundtrip.py`.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-04-30

Agent-friendly adoption: compresses Shipgate setup into a single
tool-using turn for AI coding agents.

- Added `agents-shipgate detect` — read-only command that classifies a
  workspace as an agent project and reports which framework(s) it uses,
  with confidence and per-framework evidence.
- `agents-shipgate init` now auto-detects by default. Generated
  manifests are schema-valid (validated before write) and include
  framework-specific tool sources and config blocks (LangChain, CrewAI,
  Google ADK, OpenAI Agents SDK, Anthropic, OpenAI API). The legacy
  CHANGE_ME-heavy template is preserved under `--minimal`.
- Added `agents-shipgate init --ci` — opt-in flag that writes
  `.github/workflows/agents-shipgate.yml`. Orthogonal to `--write`:
  each gets its own overwrite-refusal check. Detects cross-workflow
  shipgate references and skips with a distinct message.
- Added `agents-shipgate scan --suggest-patches` — attaches Patch
  objects to every active finding (machine-applicable for the safe
  subset; ManualPatch for everything else). `Finding.patches` is
  absent when the flag is not set; non-opting JSON consumers see no
  contract change.
- Added `agents-shipgate apply-patches` — applies patches from a scan
  JSON report. File-grouped, single SHA per file, dry-run by default,
  containment-checked against the report's new `manifest_dir` field.
- v0.6 patch generators (manifest-target only):
  - High-confidence `RemovePointerPatch` for the 3 stale-manifest
    checks (SUPPRESSION, POLICY, RISK-OVERRIDE).
  - Medium-confidence `AppendPointerPatch` for
    `SHIP-AUTH-SCOPE-COVERAGE-MISSING` (NOT applied at default
    `--confidence high` — adding scopes can encode policy choices).
  - Permanent `ManualPatch` (with anti-pattern instructions) for
    `SHIP-API-TRACE-{APPROVAL,CONFIRMATION}-MISSING` — flipping
    approved/confirmed in a trace patches the evidence, not the agent.
- Bumped report schema to v0.6 (additive: optional `Finding.patches`
  array; new top-level `manifest_dir`). v0.5 schema retained for
  reference.
- Anthropic-specific glob coverage in `init`: tools and policies
  matching `tools/anthropic-tools.json` and
  `policies/anthropic-policy.yaml` now populate the `anthropic:` block
  automatically.
- Added end-to-end agent task `02_three_command_flow` exercising the
  full `detect → init → scan → apply-patches` pipeline.
- Added `ruamel.yaml>=0.18` as a dependency for round-trip-preserving
  YAML edits in `apply-patches`.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-04-29

- Polished launch-facing docs after the v0.5.0 release.
- Updated active examples and discovery metadata to the v0.5.1 release tag.
- Added curated launch marketing and presentation assets while excluding them
  from PyPI source distributions.
- Fixed stale baseline-mode CLI help text.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-04-28

- Added static LangChain/LangGraph and CrewAI Python adapters with manifest
  source types, supplemental inventories, framework report blocks, fixtures,
  and self-check coverage.
- Added framework-specific checks for dynamic LangChain/CrewAI tool surfaces
  and missing function-tool metadata.
- Promoted GitLab CI and CircleCI to first-class integration recipes with
  advisory, strict baseline, artifact, multi-config, and tool-source trigger
  examples.
- Added report schema v0.5 for additive LangChain/CrewAI framework fields.
- Added a framework adapter checklist for future static framework support.
- Deduplicated `source_warnings`; baselines from 0.4.x may report a small
  number of resolved warning entries on first run after upgrade.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-27

- Added declarative YAML policy packs with manifest, CLI, report, SARIF, and GitHub Action support.
- Split `SHIP-API-OPERATIONAL-READINESS` into atomic OpenAI API operational readiness check IDs.
- Kept `SHIP-API-OPERATIONAL-READINESS` as a deprecated compatibility alias for suppressions, severity overrides, baseline matching, and check metadata.
- Removed the legacy top-level `check_severity_overrides` alias; use `checks.severity_overrides`.
- Added report schema v0.4 with `loaded_policy_packs` and stabilized Google ADK warnings in the framework surface.
- Added an internal framework adapter seam and documented runtime inventory as design-only.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-26

- Added static Google ADK support through `tool_sources[].type: google_adk` and supplemental `google_adk` manifest artifacts.
- Added ADK Python AST and Agent Config YAML extraction for agents, function tools, toolsets, callbacks/plugins, sub-agents, eval references, and explicit local inventories.
- Added six ADK readiness checks covering dynamic toolsets, unfiltered MCP toolsets, missing function metadata, long-running contracts, guardrail evidence, and production eval coverage.
- Added SARIF output via `--format sarif` and GitHub Action SARIF/baseline/ADK outputs.
- Added report schema v0.3 with a generic `frameworks.google_adk` surface summary.
- Added reusable local trace normalization for explicit trace/eval artifacts.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-26

- Added manifest-aware checks, deterministic report metadata, check severity overrides, `fail_on`, `init`, `doctor`, `explain`, multi-config scan support, and check entry-point hooks.
- Renamed the project to Agents Shipgate and hardened v0.1 release-readiness behavior.

## 0.1.0

- Initial Agents Shipgate MVP.
- Manifest-first scan over local MCP JSON, OpenAPI specs, and optional OpenAI Agents SDK AST metadata.
- Markdown and JSON reports.
- Advisory and strict CI modes.
- GitHub composite action.
