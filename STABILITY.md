# Stability Contract · 0.16.0

What agents and CI integrations can rely on across versions of Agents Shipgate.

Runtime contract v37 names the limits a host comparison compared past (#721).
Verifier `0.19` adds `host_comparison.unchanged_limits`, and `shipgate diff`
(capability diff `0.2`) carries the same list. A surface that is partial
(`unsupported`, `parse_failed`) or experimental on both sides, and
byte-identical between them, no longer refuses the whole comparison: the rest
is compared and each limit is named. A limit that changed, appears on one side
only, or is `unreadable` still refuses. `check`'s boundary result cannot name
limits yet and keeps refusing. See
[the migration note](#unchanged-comparison-limits-contract-v37-721).

Previous runtime contract v36 freezes the report contract at `1.0` (#569). No field is
added, renamed, retyped or removed; `minimum_control_contract_version` stays at
`21` because every operational control shape is byte-identical. The production
qualification policy's `required_report_schema_version` moves to `1.0` with the
engine, and issuance of the `pre_1_0` qualification tier is retired — existing
`pre_1_0` artifacts stay readable, nameable and scoreable, and every scoring
floor is unchanged.

Runtime contract v33 extends `detect` with `host_boundary_candidates` and
`host_discovery_incomplete_paths`. They are filename applicability and
incomplete-traversal evidence, never permission assertions. The second field
names every path the bounded census could not see through — a link it does not
follow, a directory it could not read, the entry bound — and a census that
stops publishes no candidates. It never refuses the classification: an
unreadable path withholds the product-wide negative and leaves the framework,
source and scope answers standing, the same way `audit --host` records the
failure and continues. An absent field cannot satisfy the product-wide
negative predicate. Host-only `init` returns
`manifest_status: "not_applicable_host_review"` without setup writes;
`bootstrap` returns `verdict: "host_review_required"` and the existing detect
control route. Both may exit zero with work still required, and all setup
permissions remain false.

The hand-off applies to every detection-driven `init`, including `--ci`,
`--claude-code`, `--agent-instructions` and `--local-review`, and not to
`init --minimal`. The line is what the flag does with discovery, not how
explicit it is: `--minimal` selects the legacy template without classifying
the workspace at all, so there is no classification for a host-only route to
act on. Every other mode renders from the detection this route belongs to, so
a repository whose only surface is host configuration would get a manifest
declaring nothing — the dead end #568 exists to remove. A host-only workspace
that genuinely wants a manifest asks for the template by name. Existing manifests, builder sources, and Python-cap recovery retain
their routes. Persisted release evidence and its schema versions are unchanged.

This document is the contract. If the runtime ever diverges from what's documented here, that's a bug — please file an issue.

The `report.json` schema is **frozen at `1.0`**
(`report_schema_version`, [`docs/report-schema.v1.0.json`](docs/report-schema.v1.0.json)),
satisfying the condition this document set for beginning a `1.0` line. `1.0`
is a promotion of the `0.43` shape, not a break: the two schemas are
byte-identical apart from `$id`, `title` and the version constant, so a
consumer written against `0.43` reads a `1.0` report unchanged.

`1.x` is additive-only. A minor may add a block, a member, an open-enum value
or a check ID; it may not rename, retype, remove or redefine anything. A change
that cannot be expressed additively needs `2.0`. A deprecation cycle is counted
in **shipped releases**, never in elapsed time on unreleased `main` — a
deprecation nobody could install gave nobody the chance to migrate. Every
published `docs/report-schema.v<version>.json` keeps its bytes forever.

The freeze is conditional: it holds while no breaking change lands, and a
breaking change restarts it and invalidates every qualification receipt
collected against it. The CLI surface, exit codes and `contract_version` remain
stable as described here. Pre-freeze `0.x` reports stay published and readable,
but are no longer accepted as *input* to this engine — they are refused by name
with a regeneration route rather than reinterpreted under the current model's
defaults. The stable/provisional inventory, the `1.x` rules and the migration
from the shipped `v0.15.0` contract are in
[`docs/report-1-0-contract.md`](docs/report-1-0-contract.md). Pin a version (or
the Action tag) for reproducible CI.

## Workflow capability comparison (contract v34, #685)

Host inventory, baseline and drift advance from `0.3` to `0.4`. Workflow
grants now carry per-job `permission_contexts`, `effective_write_scopes` and
`reusable_calls` (job, target
and `secrets_inherit`). Their fingerprint describes this static permission
projection; the separate artifact digest still records workflow content.
Editing a script therefore remains artifact drift without becoming a
permission-change row. Effective writes respect explicit job overrides,
including `{}`; removing an override can reveal inherited write access or
restore unknown repository defaults. Equivalent inherited and explicit grants
are quiet, and overridden workflow defaults do not become job authority.

New inherited-secret recipients are named in capability rows, including a
changed reusable target/ref. This is a declaration that the caller forwards
its available secrets, not proof of the callee's actions or access to every
organization secret. Named secret mappings, environment approvals, dynamic
expressions and transitive callee behavior are outside this comparison.
See [GitHub's reusable workflow contract](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/reusing-workflow-configurations).

The `0.1`–`0.3` readers and schemas remain unchanged. A legacy baseline is
readable but deliberately incomparable: it did not record reusable recipients
and cannot prove their absence. Preserve the old evidence and explicitly
review a replacement baseline. Git-backed `diff` scans both refs with the
current reader and needs no saved-baseline migration. Runtime contract v34
advertises the new versions; the operational control contract stays unchanged.

## Qualification coverage diagnostics (v6, #520)

`EvidenceGap.recovery` is optional explanatory metadata (#561) on the existing
open gap object. `kind` distinguishes `input_unavailable`, `reader_limitation`
and `unresolved`; `reason` records the loader's typed evidence. Current SDK
coverage and its limits are documented in [source recovery evidence](docs/qualification-coverage.md#source-recovery-evidence).
An absent field remains absent when older rows are read. Report v0.43,
packet v0.18, verifier v0.16 and qualification v6 retain their versions;
decision-bearing action kinds, declaration authorship and control permissions
are unchanged. This classification never supplies missing evidence or makes an
actual IE count as a successful qualification outcome.

`shipgate.safety_qualification` advances v5 → v6 to add `coverage_misses[]`
and `intervals[].applicability` to the existing result. Both are required on
v6; the reader checks their counts, cases and applicability against recorded
outcomes and policy. All six legacy metric values and `passed` booleans retain
their meaning. Expected-IE is explicitly `not_applicable` only when its
denominator and policy floor are both zero; it is not a coverage success.
Actual IE still loses the applicable exact-outcome score.

V5 remains readable and retains its envelope on round-trip. Existing v1/v2/v4
beta/test artifacts normalize to v5 as before; they cannot name `pre_1_0`.
Old artifacts omit the new fields, which means unrecorded rather than zero.
The typed reader rejects new fields mislabeled as an older closed grammar.
V3 remains unsupported. Corpus/receipt-index v4, report v0.43, policy labels,
thresholds and release permissions are unchanged. See
[qualification coverage](docs/qualification-coverage.md) for denominators,
unscored cases and the limits of named gap evidence.

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-report-1-0-freeze"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — the report contract is frozen at 1.0

Runtime contract `33 → 34`; `report_schema_version` moves **`0.43` → `1.0`**;
the minimum control contract stays at `21`. Packet `0.18`, verifier `0.17`,
receipt, capability-lock, attestation, preflight and host-grants schemas keep
their versions: renumbering every schema would be work without compatibility.

**The shape did not change.** `docs/report-schema.v1.0.json` and
`docs/report-schema.v0.43.json` are byte-identical apart from `$id`, `title`
and the `report_schema_version` constant. A consumer written against `0.43`
needs no change. `0.43` is the last pre-freeze version and stays published as a
frozen reference.

**What changed is the promise.** `1.x` is additive-only; a change that cannot
be expressed additively needs `2.0`; a deprecation cycle counts shipped
releases, not time on `main`; every published schema URL keeps its bytes. The
stable/provisional inventory of report fields, CLI, exit codes, Action and
control surfaces is in
[`docs/report-1-0-contract.md`](docs/report-1-0-contract.md), checked against
the runtime by `tests/test_report_1_0_contract.py`.

**Pre-freeze reports are no longer engine input.** `scan --diff-from`,
`apply-patches`, `explain-finding`, `findings`, `scenario suggest` and `evidence-packet` refuse a `0.x`
report by name, with a stable `reason_code` and a regeneration route, instead
of validating it against a model whose defaults would stand in for blocks it
never recorded. Projection readers (`explain-finding`, `findings`,
`scenario suggest`, and `evidence-packet`) accept newer `1.x` minors under the
additive promise. Comparison (`scan --diff-from`) and mutation
(`apply-patches`) refuse newer minors with an upgrade route: this build cannot
compare or apply evidence recorded under a contract it does not have.
Nothing is converted, and no artifact gains current authority by conversion or
by a restamped digest. Every superseded schema stays published, so archived
reports remain validatable.

**Qualification.** The production `beta` policy's
`required_report_schema_version` moves to `1.0`, equal to what the engine
emits. Issuance of the `pre_1_0` tier is retired: the runner will not produce
one, and `--policy-tier pre-1.0` is refused by name. The `pre_1_0` policy
itself, its thresholds and every reader of it remain, and it deliberately keeps
its historical `0.43` pin so an artifact already scored against it is still
named correctly rather than demoted to the unnamed `test` tier. No scoring
floor moved; no old evidence is re-read as `beta` qualification.

The freeze is conditional. A breaking change restarts it and invalidates every
qualification receipt collected against `1.0`.

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-human-review-decision"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — external review decisions stay separate from the gate

Runtime contract `30 → 31`; the minimum control contract stays at 21.
The standalone `shipgate.human_review_decision/v1` and
`shipgate.human_review_evaluation/v1` schemas describe an externally signed
decision and its read-only applicability evaluation. They are core integration
surfaces, not new CLI outputs. Existing durable schema bytes, artifact paths,
the action union and release/control authority remain unchanged.

The evaluator reconstructs the current request from validated evidence,
requires external host key trust and trusted reviewer eligibility, and keeps
accepted/rejected/disputed outcomes separate. It writes no file. A returned
`applicable` result is neither persistence nor permission; the integration must
retain it and the signed decision separately and re-evaluate before use.
See [the decision contract](docs/human-review-decision.md) for the independent
signature domain, trust boundary and static-artifact guarantee.

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-human-review-request"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — a review question gets a checkable postcondition

Runtime contract `29 → 30`; `minimum_control_contract_version` stays at 21.
The new standalone `shipgate.human_review_request/v1` artifact binds one
complete-evidence documentation-quality question to the existing verification
identity and full review scope. It does not change `HumanControlAction.expects`,
the shared action union, or any existing durable schema. The verifier's
extensible artifact map and terminal receipt bind the new optional file.

See [the request contract](docs/human-review-request.md) for the seven-surface
compatibility matrix, actor eligibility, accepted/rejected/disputed meanings,
and exact static-artifact boundary. A request grants no authority; until an
external authenticated decision is evaluated, existing human-owned control
remains in force. Existing signed push authorization remains push-only.


<a id="migration-note-unreleased-declaration-review"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — changed declarations become reviewer evidence

`contract_version` moves **28 → 29**, `report_schema_version` moves
**0.42 → 0.43**, packet schema moves **0.17 → 0.18**, verifier schema moves
**0.15 → 0.16**. Those artifact bumps carry the declaration-review projection.
Runtime v28
already identifies the capability-delta contract, so this release does not
reuse it for a second public surface. `minimum_control_contract_version` stays
at `21`: `AgentControl` and `shipgate.agent_control/v1` are byte-identical.

**Base-vs-head action declaration changes are explicit reviewer evidence.**
`release_decision.evidence_coverage.semantic_coverage.declaration_review`
classifies added, removed, and semantically modified declaration rows as
`evidence_consistent`, `unverified`, or `acknowledged_override`. A removed row
is always unverified. Missing or conflicting action identity, unresolved or
ambiguous selectors, semantic evidence gaps, and comparison failure cannot
earn `evidence_consistent`.

The same bounded projection feeds report Markdown, packet JSON/Markdown/HTML,
the PR comment, annotations, and the GitHub step summary. Machine consumers
must branch on `enabled`, `base_comparison_requested`,
`base_comparison_available`, `changed_count`, `summary`, and the typed row
fields; they must not infer “no declaration change” from an unavailable
comparison. A requested comparison that cannot run is rendered explicitly.

The schemas are additive. Older report, packet, and verifier documents remain
frozen and readable under their original identifiers. Declaration review is a
reviewer projection, not a second gate: `release_decision.decision` remains the
only release decision signal.

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-capability-delta-attestation"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — the capability delta becomes a published attestation

`contract_version` moves **27 → 28**. `minimum_control_contract_version` stays
at `21`, `report_schema_version` is unchanged, and no already-published schema
document changes: both the `AgentControl` union and `shipgate.agent_control/v1`
are byte-identical to v27. What moves is that a new artifact exists and the
contract advertises it.

**`verify` writes `agents-shipgate-reports/capability-delta-attestation.json`.**
It is an [in-toto](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation) Statement whose
`predicateType` is
`https://threemoonslab.com/agents-shipgate/capability-delta/v1` and whose
`predicate.delta` is the frozen `shipgate.capability_payload/v1` **delta view**,
unchanged. Full specification:
[`docs/capability-delta-attestation.md`](docs/capability-delta-attestation.md);
frozen schema:
[`docs/capability-delta-attestation-schema.v1.json`](docs/capability-delta-attestation-schema.v1.json).

**Nothing gates on it.** The attestation carries no verdict, no severity and no
per-subject release impact, by design: publishing an impact in an interchange
format invites a consumer to gate on it, which is a second verdict by another
name. `release_decision.decision` remains the only release gate, and no exit
code, verdict, finding, or check id changes.

**Six additive fields on the runtime contract**, published on both
`agents-shipgate contract --json` and `.well-known/agents-shipgate.json`:
`capability_payload_schema_version`, `capability_payload_schema_path`,
`capability_delta_attestation_schema_version`,
`capability_delta_attestation_schema_path`,
`capability_delta_predicate_type`, and
`capability_delta_attestation_artifact`. `external_integration_surfaces[]` gains
`capability_payload` and `capability_delta_attestation`, and `artifacts{}` gains
`capability_delta_attestation`. `shipgate.capability_payload/v1` itself was
frozen in the previous cycle and deliberately left unregistered while nothing
emitted it; registering a schema no artifact carries would have been a contract
bump with nothing behind it, so both halves land here.

**Two things a consumer must branch on, not probe for.**

- **The artifact is absent for a worktree run.** It attests a committed tree,
  and a `verify` invoked without `--head` evaluates a worktree snapshot whose
  bytes are in no tree object. Such a run writes no attestation and appends a
  note to `verifier.base_notes[]` saying why. The GitHub Action always passes an
  explicit `--head`, so CI runs are unaffected. Absence is not "the delta was
  empty".
- **`predicate.verification.status` is `bound` or `unbound`.** Only `bound`
  carries `input_set_id` and `subject_id`, and the schema refuses every other
  combination. A consumer that requires the chain into
  `verification-receipt.json` checks the status. `verify` always emits `bound`.

**`shipgate.capability_delta_attestation/v1` is closed, like its payload.**
Every object forbids extra properties and every vocabulary is a closed enum, so
there is no compatible in-place widening: any addition, removal, or change of
meaning is `…/capability-delta/v2`, published beside `v1`, with `v1` remaining
readable for at least one minor cycle. This is deliberately the opposite promise
from `report.json`, which is open by construction and additive within a version.

**Verifying one requires nothing of ours.**
[`tools/verify-capability-delta.py`](tools/verify-capability-delta.py) is
stdlib-only and applies every published rule; the rule ids it reports are listed
on the spec page. It enforces the closed v1 vocabularies itself rather than
deferring to a JSON Schema library, so the default command rejects
out-of-contract content without one.

The statement is emitted **unsigned** in `v1`: a passing run establishes
self-consistency and that the subject is the state the delta describes, not
authorship. Wrap the bytes in a DSSE envelope, or trust the transport.

Two things a consumer must not confuse. `verification.status: "bound"` is the
producer's claim; `--receipt <path>` is the check, joining the identities and
the artifact-manifest digest against a receipt you supply.
`--require-receipt-binding` refuses an `unbound` statement and nothing more.

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-verifier-explanations"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — verifier explanations name the cause that acted

That projection-only change moved no schema or runtime-contract version. It
landed against the v0.42 report schema with the typed `unattested_surface` gap
and optional `EvidenceGap.policy_id`; consumers must continue to branch on
typed fields rather than matching prose.

- Every completed blocked verifier run now routes its plain headline through
  the same deterministic blocker picker already used by the adoption and
  self-approval branches. `verifier.headline`, `control.reason`, and
  `control.next_action.why` therefore append `Most severe: <title>.` even when
  the diff introduces no manifest and touches no trust root. The picker is
  unchanged: severity, then check id, then title. Runs with no blocker are
  byte-identical on this clause.
- A genuinely incomplete enumeration remains `incomplete_surface`. A
  lower-confidence extraction without an enumeration defect is now the distinct
  `unattested_surface` gap; only an explicit adapter fact of
  `surface: enumerated` earns the positive “enumerated surface” explanation.
  Its remedy asks for reviewed attestation rather than asking the adapter to
  enumerate tools it already found.
- Policy-evidence gap prose no longer prefixes `why` with an engine-owned
  `builtin-*` policy id. Public `SHIP-*` and organization-defined check ids
  remain as stable labels. `mixed_policy_evidence` names the authoritative and
  heuristic evidence in tension and the reviewed action that closes the gap;
  exact identity remains in optional `EvidenceGap.policy_id`, including an
  engine-owned id; the `builtin-*` prohibition applies to adopter prose, not
  structured identity. Machine consumers keep using the structured gap kind,
  subject, policy id, source, and target path.
- Blocker titles are budgeted by UTF-8 bytes before the plain headline is
  composed. The generated verdict and cause clause stay whole; lower-priority
  context is retained only as complete sentences when it fits in the 400-byte
  control-envelope prose budget.

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-embedded-trigger-routing"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — embedded trigger advice is consumed by verifier control

No schema or runtime-contract version moves, and standalone
`agents-shipgate trigger --json` output is unchanged. When the same trigger
evaluation is embedded in `verifier.json`, `verify-run.json`, or preview
output, `trigger.next_action.kind` preserves the evaluated state (`command`,
`input_required`, `stop`, or `none`) while its command is cleared and the row
carries `authoritative: false` and
`authoritative_path: "control.next_action"`. Commands on embedded
`trigger.matched_rules[]` are cleared as well. Its explanation says the
verifier already consumed the trigger route.

This prevents `verify --preview --json` from publishing a self-referential
preview command above the initialize/verify command that actually governs the
run. Embedded `trigger` remains relevance evidence; `control.next_action` and
`control.allowed_next_commands` remain the only operational route. Consumers
that used embedded `trigger.next_action.command` must switch to
`control.next_action.command`. Consumers of the standalone trigger command do
not change.

---

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-pre-1-0-evidence-bar"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — the pre-1.0 release evidence bar

`shipgate.safety_qualification` advances **v4 → v5**. The corpus
(`shipgate.safety_corpus/v4`) and receipt-index
(`shipgate.safety_receipt_index/v4`) envelopes **do not move**: their grammar is
unchanged, and these versions track grammar rather than release batches. No
`contract_version`, `report_schema_version`, or published adopter-facing schema
document changes.

Two grammar changes force the bump. `qualification_tier` gains `pre_1_0`
alongside `beta` and `test`, and the result now carries a cross-field
invariant: `production_qualified` is true exactly when a `qualified` artifact
claims the `beta` tier. A v4 reader admits neither, so a genuine `pre_1_0`
artifact must not claim to be v4.

**Reader behaviour.** The v5 reader accepts `shipgate.safety_qualification/v1`,
`/v2` and `/v4` **only when the payload uses the vocabulary that envelope can
express** — that is, `qualification_tier` of `beta` or `test`. Such a payload is
read as v5, because it is a v5 payload with identical meaning. A payload
carrying `pre_1_0` under a legacy envelope is *rejected*, not upgraded: an
unconditional upgrade would recreate the v4/`pre_1_0` combination this bump
exists to eliminate, leaving an old v4 reader able to receive an artifact it
cannot parse. Both release gates enforce the pairing — the standard-library
sealer on raw JSON, since it never parses the envelope otherwise. Nothing emits
v4 any more, and v3 is still not read, as before.

**What this is for.** `0.x` tags are now governed by a named 38-case `pre_1_0`
policy, decided under
[#341](https://github.com/ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate/issues/341) and recorded
in [`docs/release-evidence-policy-decision.md`](docs/release-evidence-policy-decision.md).
It reduces evidence *coverage* only: the zero-unsafe-auto-pass rule, per-case
receipts, the holdout fraction, the κ floor and `static_only` are unchanged, and
every exact-match floor is the production rate rounded up. `1.0` and later still
require the 80-case `beta` artifact, and there is no promotion shortcut.
<a id="migration-note-unreleased-setup-error-envelope"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — no corpus case targets `insufficient_evidence`

**No schema version moves.** `shipgate.safety_qualification` stays at v5, the
corpus and receipt-index envelopes are unchanged, and no field is added,
renamed, or removed. `insufficient_evidence` remains in
`ReleaseDecisionStatus`, the verifier still emits it, and
`minimum_insufficient_evidence_exact` remains a required field of the
`requirements` block.

**What changes is the contents of the two named policies.** No stratum targets
`insufficient_evidence` any more, so both tiers lose seven cells: `beta` goes
28 cells / 100 cases → 21 / 80, and `pre_1_0` 28 / 56 → 21 / 38. Four
`pre_1_0` `blocked` cells hold one case rather than two, because no second real
case exists for them. The floors that count those cases follow:
`minimum_insufficient_evidence_exact` becomes `0` in both tiers,
`minimum_blocked_exact` becomes `10` for `pre_1_0`, and
`minimum_qualified_origins` becomes `32` / `16` — the same 40% share of a
smaller corpus, not a smaller share.

**No rate moved**, which is the property to check if you are reading this to
find out whether the bar got easier. Every exact-match floor is still
production's rate applied to the population it governs, rounded up, and
`test_the_pre_1_0_policy_is_never_laxer_than_production_per_rate` fails if a
floor is one case laxer than that.

**Who is affected.** Nobody consuming a published artifact: none exists yet at
either tier. A qualification artifact built against the previous shape is
rejected by both release gates — with `case profile/outcome strata do not match
the <tier> policy` and a case-count error — and must be rebuilt. The reasoning
is recorded in
[`docs/release-evidence-policy-decision.md`](docs/release-evidence-policy-decision.md)
§ Amendment 3, under
[#520](https://github.com/ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate/issues/520).

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — the setup control envelope reaches both streams

`contract_version` moves **26 → 27**. `minimum_control_contract_version` stays
at `21`, `report_schema_version` is unchanged, and no published schema document
changes: both the `AgentControl` union and `shipgate.agent_control/v1` are
byte-identical to v26. What moves is where an already-published object appears.

**Every agent-mode error line from `detect`, `init`, and `doctor` now carries
`control`.** v24 gave those commands the envelope on their `--json` payload and
left the error stream out; `doctor`'s failure routes picked it up during that
rollout, and `detect`'s and five of `init`'s did not. So whether a caller
that routes on `control` could route at all depended on which setup command had
failed and on which of its failures — and the run that most needs a route is
the one that printed no payload to carry it. The `next_action` and
`next_actions[]` **fields** are unchanged on those lines, and are derived from
the same selected route as `control.next_action`; two of their command *values*
move, and both are listed under "Routing behaviour" below.

**What a consumer may rely on across every setup error line**, enforced by the
published schema and not only by the producer: `decision_source: "setup"`, a
`decision` from `setup_complete | setup_incomplete | setup_not_applicable`,
every field of `permissions` false, and `control_state` never `complete`.
Setup authorizes nothing, on either stream.

**`execution` is not a stream marker, and must not be read as one.** The
`error` field is what says a line is an error. `execution` answers a different
question — whether the command reached an answer about the workspace — and both
values occur on error lines:

| `execution` | When | Examples |
| ----------- | ---- | -------- |
| `"failed"` | The command could not reach an answer. | An unparseable `--control-pack` or `--agent-instructions` value, discovery that could not be bounded, a manifest that could not be opened or decoded, a generated manifest that failed validation. |
| `"succeeded"`, with a non-zero `exit_code` | The command reached an answer and that answer is a refusal it can route past. | `config_already_exists` (`init --write` declining to overwrite), and the unresolved-scope `config_error`. |

Do not infer authority from either value: the row above that says `"succeeded"`
still carries `permissions` all false, because it is a setup envelope.

**Two error lines still carry no `control`, by design.** The shared
`--workspace` refusal (`config_error`, exit 2, emitted by every command that
takes a `--workspace`) fires because that workspace does not exist, so there is no setup
subject for `input_id` to address; and `environment_error` is emitted before
Agents Shipgate is running and carries `environment` instead. `scan`, `verify`,
and `check` error lines are also unchanged: the first two answer through their
control pointer, and `check` — which publishes no pointer — through
`--format agent-control-json`.

**Routing behaviour: three changes, none of them additive.**

**1.** `init --write` over
a manifest that already exists published `next_action.kind: "edit"` on
`shipgate.yaml` with `expects: "The manifest reflects the desired tool sources,
agent declared_purpose, and policies"`. That postcondition was already
satisfied whenever the route was reached: a manifest that does *not* load is
claimed by the repair route above it. On this contract `next_action` **is** the
step, so the route could not change the answer — an envelope-only caller opened
the file, found nothing to change, re-ran, and received the identical action.
It is now `next_action.kind: "command"` naming the `doctor` invocation for the
manifest on disk, which reports what that manifest still owes. Exit code 2 and
the "already exists — edit it directly or remove it before re-running init
--write" sentence are unchanged; a consumer that branched on
`next_action.kind == "edit"` here now sees `"command"` — **except** when this
invocation asked for a manifest configuration the existing manifest does not
carry. `init --write --control-pack <id>` over a manifest selecting a different
pack routes to a reconciliation naming `policies.control_pack` and the exact
value, because both onward routes would otherwise advance under the pack that
is *there* and the request would be lost without anything saying so. The same
reconciliation is published for a scoped **candidate** project whose manifest
selects a different pack, where the candidate's `doctor` route had the same
effect.

"Asked for" is read from the argument parser rather than inferred by comparing
against the default. An explicit `--control-pack default` over a
`financial-strict` manifest is a request — and the only one that can *only*
weaken — so a default-comparison could not see it.

**The owner of that route is the direction, not the caller.** A governed coding
agent writes its own argv, so command-line arguments are not authenticated
human provenance for loosening a gate. A transition that keeps at least every
obligation the manifest has today is `agent_action_required` with a typed
`edit`. One that drops any obligation, or that names a pack this build cannot
resolve, is `human_review_required` with no command and names what it would
remove. The comparison is `weakened_pack_obligations`, shared with the
`control_pack_weakened` check rather than restated.

**2.** Every recovery command `init` publishes now repeats the **whole**
invocation with only the invalid value corrected. They were built from the
smaller flag list that a rerun in a *different* workspace may repeat, so
`init --write --minimal --control-pack <bad>` emitted a recovery without
`--minimal` — following it wrote an auto-detected manifest instead of the legacy
template that was asked for. `--minimal`, `--allow-unresolved-scope`,
`--agent-instructions-kit`, and a non-default `--max-python-files` now ride
along. Command *values* change; no field is added or removed.

**3.** The `internal_error` route for a generated manifest that fails validation
named a bare `agents-shipgate init --minimal`. It now names the same invocation
with `--minimal` added — the workspace, `--write`, and `--json` are carried
through, so following it writes the fallback template where the caller asked
for it rather than in the process directory. This is a `next_action` /
`next_actions[0].command` value change on a route that is now also
`control.next_action.command`.

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — adopter-facing output stops naming internal fields

No version moves: `contract_version`, `report_schema_version`,
`minimum_control_contract_version`, and every published schema document are
unchanged. No field is removed or retyped and no error kind is added. What
changes is the *wording* of strings a person is expected to read and act on,
three published field values, one additive field on the agent-mode error
envelope, and one narrowed manifest value — each detailed below.

**The rule.** Internal identity vocabulary — `source_type`, `source_id`,
`native_locator`, observation ids, fingerprints, and derived `tool_v…` /
`agent_v…` identifiers — may appear as evidence in machine-read artifacts. It
may not appear in anything whose purpose is to tell a person what to do next:
console output, the agent-mode `next_action` / `next_actions[]` / `message`,
`agent-handoff.json` prose, `fix_task.instructions[]`, and PR comment text.
`report.json` evidence blocks, `tool_catalog`, `identity_assessment`, and the
verification artifacts are unchanged — they are the identity model and are
supposed to be precise. `tests/test_adopter_vocabulary.py` enforces the rule.

**Messages that changed.** All are prose; none is a documented identifier.

| Where | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `input_parse_error`, one artifact read twice for a source | `Duplicate tool observation identity: source_type='google_adk_function', source_id='google_adk:agent.py', native_locator='agent.py#map_account'` | `'agent.py' was read twice as one tool source, so the tool 'map_account' arrived twice. Remove the repeated shipgate.yaml entry naming 'agent.py', then re-run the scan.` |
| `input_parse_error`, one artifact defining a tool twice | *(the same message — the two causes were indistinguishable)* | `'tools.json' defines the tool 'pay' more than once, so one tool source produced it twice. Remove the duplicate definition from 'tools.json', then re-run the scan.` |
| source warning, one tool in several bindings | `Tool observation obs_v1_3f9a1c2b… appears in multiple bindings: b1, b2` | `Tool 'process_order' from 'agent.py' is claimed by more than one tool_identity.bindings entry: 'b1', 'b2'. …` |
| source warning, binding member that resolves to the wrong count | `member source_id='orders_b', tool='process_order' matched 0 observations` | `… matched 0 tools in that source, not exactly one — correct the member at shipgate.yaml#tool_identity.bindings so it names one tool` |
| `SHIP-DIAG-UNKNOWN-ADAPTER-SOURCE-TYPE` title | `Unknown adapter source_type 'acme' …` | `No adapter handles tool_sources[].type 'acme' in shipgate.yaml …` |
| `incomplete_tool_identity` gap `accepted_values` | `["unique_source_id", "stable_native_locator"]` | `["unique_source_id", "stable_source_path"]` |

**One gap subject changes value.** A binding gap whose issue names no tool
falls back to the agent, and the fallback was the derived agent id. It is now
the same kind of label a tool subject already is:

| Report | `evidence_gaps[].subject` before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `samples/conductor_agent` | `agent_v1:7205d836e4b3fee257d90695` | `durable_order_agent [conductor_workflows]` |
| `samples/support_refund_agent` | `agent_v1:7cb237a00d64b7400f4adc3b` | `refund_agent [openai_sdk_static]` |

`release_decision.reason`, `agent_summary.first_recommended_action.why`, the
CLI `Improve evidence:` line, and the GitHub step summary all print that
subject, so they change with it. **A consumer that joined on
`evidence_gaps[].subject` for these rows should read the agent id from
`binding_surface_facts.agents[].agent_id` instead** — `subject` is documented
as a display label, and this was the last kind of id still in it. The
report's conservation invariant now refuses *any* derived id in a gap subject,
matched by shape, so neither kind can return.

**One field is added.** The agent-mode `input_parse_error` envelope may carry
`details`, an object holding the diagnostic identifiers that left the message —
for the duplicate-tool failure: `failure`, `cause`, `source_type`, `source_id`,
`native_locator`, `tool_name`, `source_file`, and `manifest_path`; plus
`manifest_placeholders` (the manifest fields still holding `CHANGE_ME`, which
is what the placeholder recovery now routes on instead of searching the failure
text) and `evaluated_ref` / `manifest_in_ref` for a failure evaluated against a
ref. It is absent when a failure carries no such payload, and it is never
required to act on the error. Route on `details.failure` and `details.cause`
rather than on message text; `docs/errors.json` documents them.

`details.manifest_path` is the manifest the run actually read. It matters
because the emitted `edit` action names it: a `scan --workspace <repo>` that
discovers a sole nested `services/billing/shipgate.yaml`, or a `verify` with no
`--config`, previously published `path: "shipgate.yaml"` — a different file in
the caller's working directory. A consumer reconstructing the manifest from the
invocation should read this field instead.

**Two published values move.** The `incomplete_tool_identity` gap's
`next_action.path` is now `shipgate.yaml#tool_sources`, matching the repair its
`expects` and `accepted_values` describe; it was `shipgate.yaml#tool_identity`,
which sent an agent routing on `path` to a different section than the sentence
beside it. And the gap kinds where a *reference* failed to resolve —
`unresolved_agent_binding`, `unresolved_bound_tool`, `incomplete_handoff_graph`
— are now subjected by their `source_pointer` rather than by the agent that
made the reference, which is the healthy one: a handoff to a missing worker
was subjected `root [sdk]` and carried that name into the verdict and the fix
task.

**`next_actions[].path` is the one field a caller may open verbatim, and it
now always is.** An `edit` action names the manifest the run actually read:
`--workspace` discovery can select a nested `services/billing/shipgate.yaml`,
`verify` and `verification prepare` default `--config`, and an archived
`verify --base/--head` reads a temporary tree that is deleted before the error
is handled. The `CHANGE_ME` placeholder recovery, whose `path` was previously
the literal string `shipgate.yaml`, is included.

Two consequences follow from that rule rather than from any single fix.
A **declared artifact** is never published as a `path` at all — it has no one
base (the manifest's for most sources, the *entrypoint's* for an inventory a
framework file mounts), so the duplicate-inside-an-artifact recovery is a
`review` action that names the artifact in its sentence. And a failure
**evaluated against a ref that is not checked out** publishes no `path`
either: the archive is gone and the working tree may already hold the fix, so
the action names the commit and the path within it (`details.evaluated_ref`,
`details.manifest_in_ref`). Paths inside `details` are recorded as the loader
saw them and are *not* verbatim-openable; `docs/errors.json` says so.

**One manifest value is canonicalized.** `ArtifactPathConfig.path` — every
declared artifact under a framework block — is normalized, so `./tools.json`
and `tools.json` are one declaration. Declaring both used to read one file
twice and produce *two* canonical tools, with no duplicate detected and no
warning. A path containing a backslash is left exactly as written, and `..`
segments are preserved so the containment checks downstream still see what the
author wrote.

**One manifest value is narrowed.** `tool_sources[].id` is stripped, and a
blank id is now a `config_error` (exit 2) at manifest load instead of an
`input_parse_error` (exit 3) during the scan. The id is the key
`tool_inventories[].source_id` and `tool_identity.bindings[].members[].source_id`
join on, and both of those were already stripped where they are declared — so
`id: " orders "` matched neither and silently completed nothing. A manifest with
a blank or padded id was already not doing what it looked like it was doing;
now it says so at the point the value is read.

`docs/manifest-v0.1.json` carries the rule too, as `"pattern": "\\S"` on
`ToolSourceConfig.id`: the published schema is part of the manifest contract,
and a consumer validating against it would otherwise accept an id the runtime
refuses. A parity test asserts the two agree on empty, whitespace-only, and
padded ids.

**`verify` now routes this failure the way `scan` does.** Both commands, and
the verifier assembly path, share one recovery resolver, so a duplicate tool
source yields an `edit` action naming the manifest instead of the generic
"inspect the file referenced in the error" review action. The error kind and
exit code (3) are unchanged.

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-effect-coverage"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — effect coverage, and the schemas that stayed frozen

Two capability schemas move: `capability_lock_schema_version` `0.6` → `0.7` and
`capability_lock_diff_schema_version` `0.7` → `0.8`. `report_schema_version`
(`0.42`), `packet_schema_version` (`0.17`), `verifier_schema_version` (`0.14`),
`contract_version`, and the manifest `version: "0.1"` are unchanged.

**Four published documents are restored to the bytes they were published with.**
`declaration_below_inferred_evidence` had been written into
`docs/packet-schema.v0.12.json`, `docs/verifier-schema.v0.9.json`,
`docs/capability-lock-schema.v0.6.json`, and
`docs/capability-lock-diff-schema.v0.7.json` while each kept its version
identifier. A consumer pinned to any of them was rejecting artifacts that
document is supposed to describe. The value now reaches only the current
document of each family, and the two capability schemas — which had no
successor version at all — gain one.

**A lock written under `0.6` still loads.** It is advanced to `0.7` on read, the
way a `0.12` packet and a `0.9` verifier artifact already are. Nothing needs
regenerating.

**A declaration accounts for an inferred observation on two conditions, not
one.** It must rank at or above the observation under both published effect
orders, *and* oblige at least that observation's built-in controls. Rank alone
is not enough: `financial_write` outranks `external_communication` but requires
no confirmation, which is what communicating outward requires. A repository
declaring a higher-risk effect across categories — `financial_write` on a tool
inferred to communicate externally — now raises
`declaration_below_inferred_evidence` where it was previously silent, and the
row names the controls rather than telling the reviewer to raise an effect that
is already higher. Coverage reads every policy-eligible claim on the action, so
a `risk_tags: [financial_action]` entry accounts for an inferred
`financial_write` exactly as the built-in control evaluator already treats it.

Nothing that gated before stops gating: the policy-applicability predicate now
asks the same question, and its new form is a strict superset of the rank
comparison it replaces.

**The row's repair may now be a `risk_tags` edit rather than an `effect` one.**
Where no single observed effect covers every uncovered observation *and* the
declared value, `next_action.expects` asks for
`action_surface.actions[].risk_tags`, `accepted_values` carries risk-tag values
rather than effect values, and the scaffold template includes the filled
`risk_tags` list. A consumer that assumed this row's `accepted_values` is always
the effect vocabulary should read `next_action.declaration_template` for the
shape.

**`acknowledged_overrides` emits one row per suppressed observation.** An
override that waives two inferred readings previously produced one row naming
only the strongest. The field set is unchanged; a consumer counting rows per
action may now see more than one, keyed by `subject_id` with distinct
`inferred_effect` values.

---

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-gap-subject-labels"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — every gap subject is a label, never a raw id

No version moves: `contract_version`, `report_schema_version`,
`minimum_control_contract_version`, and every published schema document are
unchanged. No field is added, removed, or retyped — `subject` is still a
required string and `subject_id` already shipped in report schema `0.35`. What
changes is which value lands in which field.

**`evidence_gaps[].subject` is a display label everywhere now.** The policy
evidence gaps — every row of `report.policy_evidence_gaps`, also merged into
`release_decision.evidence_coverage.evidence_gaps` — put the raw canonical tool
id in the label and left `subject_id` null:

| Gap kind | `subject` before | `subject` after | `subject_id` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inferred_policy_applicability` and the other kinds raised per finding | `tool_v2_2c9ee6ae…` | `send_email_preview [openai_sdk_static]` | was `null`, now `tool_v2_2c9ee6ae…` |
| `mixed_policy_evidence` and the other kinds raised per action | `support.search_kb [tool_v2_445a251a…]` | `support.search_kb [support_mcp_tools]` | was `null`, now `tool_v2_445a251a…` |
| any kind raised per policy-pack rule | `create_refund [tool_v2_6dcebe42…]` | `create_refund [api]` | was `null`, now `tool_v2_6dcebe42…` |

The label reaches readers: `evidence_gap_headline` prints it in the CLI's
`Improve evidence:` line, in the decision reason, and in the GitHub step
summary, where a 64-hex digest names nothing anyone can open.
`samples/support_refund_agent` had `support.search_kb` in one gap list under
both spellings at once.

**A consumer that joined `evidence_gaps[].subject` against
`tool_catalog[].tool_id` should join on `subject_id`,** which is the field
documented for identity and is now populated on these rows for the first time.
Joining on the label was always ambiguous — two catalog ids can render the same
`name [provider]`. The report's own conservation invariant now refuses a raw
canonical id *anywhere* in any gap's `subject` — matched by shape, so a
wrapped id (`create_refund [tool_v2_6dcebe42…]`) and an id that resolves to no
catalog row are refused too. The raw form cannot return for a kind that happens
to be exempt today.

**Labels are resolved from the tool catalog by `tool_id`.** Two of these
emitters previously rendered from their own fields, which diverged from the
catalog for the same tool: `ActionFact.provider` is
`_normalize_token(provider or source_id or source_type)`, so a source id of
`my api` produced `create_refund [my_api]` on an action-policy gap and
`create_refund [my api]` on a catalog-backed one. A tool whose id resolves to
no catalog row is labelled by its name, or failing that by the check id that
raised the gap — never by the id itself, which stays in `subject_id`.

Subjects that never named a catalog tool — agent ids, source-loader warning
text — are unchanged, and keep `subject_id: null`.

---

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-absent-input"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — an absent input is refused, not misreported

No version moves: `contract_version`, `report_schema_version`,
`minimum_control_contract_version`, and every published schema document are
unchanged. No new error kind and no new exit code — the refusals below all use
the existing `config_error` / exit `2` slot published in
[`docs/errors.json`](docs/errors.json).

**`--workspace` must name an existing directory, on every command that takes
it.** A path that does not exist is an invocation error, decided before any
output directory is resolved and before anything is written. This changes
observable behavior in three ways, all of them narrowing a case that
previously "succeeded":

- `verify --preview` no longer exits 0 for a `--workspace` that does not
  exist. Its documented "always exits 0" holds for every workspace it
  *evaluates*; an absent path is not one, and preview previously created the
  entire path and wrote its artifact set into it before answering
  ([#389](https://github.com/ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate/issues/389)).
- `detect`, `check`, `trigger`, `mcp audit`, and `install-hooks` previously
  exited 0 with a payload describing a workspace that was not there; they now
  exit 2 with `config_error`.
- `init --write`, `audit --host`, and `verification prepare`/`worker`
  previously raised an unhandled `FileNotFoundError` (exit 1); they now exit 2
  with `config_error`.

A caller that passes an existing `--workspace` — every documented invocation —
is unaffected. Commands whose `--workspace` is optional still accept its
absence, which means "discover instead", not "a workspace that is missing".

**Three manifest states, three messages.** An absent manifest, an empty one,
and a present-but-not-a-mapping one previously produced one identical
`Config file must contain a YAML object: <path>` string while routing to two
different actions, so `control.reason` and `control.next_action` could
disagree about whether the file existed
([#384](https://github.com/ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate/issues/384)). The
messages are now:

| State | Message | `next_action.kind` |
|---|---|---|
| absent | `Config file not found: <path> in <cwd>.` (plus the `init --write` hint for `shipgate.yaml`) | `verify` |
| empty | `Config file is empty: <path>.` | `edit` |
| not a mapping | `Config file must contain a YAML object: <path>` | `edit` |

Routing is unchanged — it always distinguished the cases. `ConfigError` and
exit `2` are unchanged for all three. Consumers that pattern-matched on the
`must contain a YAML object` text to detect a *missing* manifest must switch
to the diagnostic id (`SHIP-DIAG-MISSING-MANIFEST`) or to
`control.next_action`, which is what the recovery hint in `docs/errors.json`
already directs.

**A manifest type mismatch is a `config_error`, not an `internal_error`.**
`raise TypeError` inside a Pydantic validator propagates past the
config-loading boundary; the manifest schema now raises `ValueError`
throughout, so a YAML mapping where a list belongs produces
`Invalid shipgate.yaml:` with the offending field path and an `edit` route,
the same as any other manifest validation failure
([#387](https://github.com/ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate/issues/387)). Error
text for these fields changed shape (it now names what was written, e.g.
"must be a list of artifact paths, but is a mapping"); the field path prefix
is the stable part.

---

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-doctor-environment"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — `doctor --json` reports the environment that answered

No version moves: `contract_version`, `report_schema_version`,
`minimum_control_contract_version`, and every published schema document are
unchanged. This is additive on two surfaces and adds one error kind.

**Every `doctor --json` payload gains an `environment` field**, and so does
every `doctor` agent-mode error line — including the discovery failure, where
`--json` prints no payload at all. It states the running interpreter, the
launcher and any `agents-shipgate` / `shipgate` console script on `PATH`, where
the imported package came from, the installed / imported / source-tree versions,
and `mismatches[]`. Every existing field on those payloads is unchanged, and
`environment` is deliberately **not** folded into `control.input_id`: it carries
absolute machine-specific paths, and `input_id` is the identity of what `doctor`
decided about a manifest, which the environment does not change. The same
manifest therefore keeps the same `input_id` on every machine, as before.
Field-by-field contents are in
[`docs/diagnostics.md`](docs/diagnostics.md#which-shipgate-answered-the-environment-block).

**New agent-mode error kind `environment_error`, exit code 4** — the existing
"other agents-shipgate error" code, not a new one. It is emitted by the
repository launcher before any Shipgate code is running (an unsupported
interpreter, or one that cannot import the package or its dependencies), so it
is the only kind that carries no `control` envelope; it carries `environment`
instead. Published in [`docs/errors.json`](docs/errors.json), whose
`schema_version` stays `0.1`. A consumer that switches on `error` and falls
through on unknown kinds is unaffected.

**New public helper `agents_shipgate.invocation.render_cli_override`** — the
host-rules inverse of how `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_CLI` is parsed. It exists because
that variable now has a writer: the repository launcher announces itself through
it. `join_argv` remains POSIX on every platform and is unchanged; the two are
not interchangeable, and the docstrings say which parser each one pairs with.

The launcher itself, `./shipgate`, is a development entry point in the source
tree. It is not part of the wheel and nothing under `src/` imports it, so it
changes nothing for an installed Agents Shipgate.

---

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-setup-control-envelope"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — one control vocabulary across the setup commands

Runtime contract `23 → 24`. `minimum_control_contract_version` **stays at 21**,
and the `AgentControl` union is byte-identical to v21.

A typed `edit` action was added to that union for setup routing and then removed
*from the union*. The union is embedded by six durable published schemas —
verifier, agent-handoff, preflight, agent-result, agent-boundary-result, and
verify-run — so widening it widened all six under unchanged identifiers, and five
of those artifacts record no `contract_version` for a consumer holding a stored
payload to disambiguate with.

The two surfaces therefore say the same step differently, and a reader needs both
halves:

- **The emitted envelope** (`shipgate.agent_control/v1`, stdout only) publishes
  the edit itself: `control.next_action` is `{"kind": "edit", "path": …,
  "expects": …, "command": null}`, declared as `SetupEditAction` on this document
  alone. **`control.next_action.path` is the file to open**, exact and
  unnormalized. This is the field to route on.
- **The shared `AgentControl` object** those durable artifacts embed cannot hold
  that variant, so it carries the `configure` command that *checks* the edit,
  with the file named in `why`.

Routing an envelope-only consumer at the check alone was tried and withdrawn: it
re-ran `doctor` against an unchanged file and returned the identical action
forever.

What v24 does widen is `shipgate.agent_control/v1` itself — new `operation`
values, `decision_source: "setup"`, and closed per-source `decision`
vocabularies. That document is emitted on stdout and never written as an
artifact, so there are no stored envelopes to disambiguate and its new
operations cannot appear in anything a v21 consumer holds.

**Runtime contract v25 uses the same split once more.** `verify` publishes
`control.next_action.kind: "confirm_declarations"` on a working-tree run whose
verdict is `insufficient_evidence` and at least one open declaration question is
one the scan can answer from its own evidence. It is not published on a
ref-bound run: `apply-patches` mutates the checkout, so the exact rerun would
re-scan the commit the edit is not in yet. The action carries the exact
`apply-patches` command plus `questions[]` (each row tagged `authorable_by`,
capped at six, human-owned rows first, with `agent_authorable` /
`human_authorable` as the real totals). The shared `AgentControl` again holds
the same step as the `repair` command it truthfully is, so it is unchanged and
`minimum_control_contract_version` stays at `21`. Authority does not move with
the route: `permissions` is publish-only — `edit`, `commit`, `push`,
`update_pr` true; `merge` and `report_complete` false — because writing a
declaration touches the trust root and a person still merges it.

**Two routing behaviours change**, and neither is additive:

- `init --write` no longer names a runnable `scan` in `next_action` when the
  manifest it wrote still holds an unresolved human-owned declaration. Both
  `next_action` and `next_actions[0]` now carry the same human review route the
  control envelope does. This is the point of the change: the previous pairing
  published an executable command that would carry an unfilled
  `agent.declared_purpose` into a release decision, beside a control state that
  authorized nothing (#325).
- A remediation with no faithful argv form — a leading `NAME=VALUE` assignment,
  or a `<placeholder>` — routes the *envelope* to a human rather than into
  `control.next_action.command`. `next_actions[]` is unaffected: `NextAction`
  already withholds its computed `executable`/`args` pair in that case and lets
  the rendered string stand, which is an option the envelope's command field
  does not have.

**`detect --json`, `init --json`, and every `doctor --json` payload gain a
`control` field.** It holds the same `shipgate.agent_control/v1` envelope that
`verify --format control`, `check --format agent-control-json`, and
`agents-shipgate agent control` already emit — same schema document, same
`control_state`, same six-way `permissions` vector. Additive: every existing
field on those payloads, including `next_action` and `next_actions[]`, is
unchanged, and the agent-mode *error* line still carries the ranked-action
fields rather than a control object.

**Setup control is distinguishable from gate control, in both directions.**
These commands run before a release decision exists, so their envelope carries
`decision_source: "setup"` and a `decision` from the closed vocabulary
`setup_complete | setup_incomplete | setup_not_applicable`. The published JSON
Schema requires `decision_source: "setup"` to come from `detect`/`init`/`doctor`
*and* requires those operations to report no other source, so a reader switching
on `decision_source` can never take a setup verdict for
`release_decision.decision`.

**A setup envelope authorizes nothing.** Setup reads no diff, so all six
`permissions` are `false`, no setup envelope binds an artifact or a
`current_control_id`, and `control_state: "complete"` is unreachable for these
operations because `CompleteControlEnvelope.operation` is fixed to
`verify`/`check`. A successful `init` is not permission to commit, merge, or
report a task complete.

**Unresolved human-owned manifest placeholders route to a human.** When
`shipgate.yaml` still carries an unresolved `declared_purpose`,
`prohibited_actions`, policy, or permission value, the setup control state is
`human_review_required` and the action names the exact file, line, and field.
These are declarations a person makes; the same rule already governs
`do_not_auto_assert` and `baseline save --owner/--reason`. Placeholders an agent
can legitimately resolve from the repository — a tool-source path, a project
name — stay coding-agent work.

**`next_action` can be `kind: "edit"` — on setup operations only.** A typed
coding-agent step carrying `path` and `expects` and no `command`, for work that
is unambiguously the agent's and has no executable form. It is declared as
`SetupEditAction` on the *envelope* rather than in the shared `AgentControl`
union, so the six durable schemas that embed that union are untouched, and both
layers reject an edit route on any operation but `detect`/`init`/`doctor`.

**Human-owned declarations cover every `do_not_auto_assert` surface with a
manifest spelling.** Unresolved placeholders under `agent_bindings`,
`tool_identity`, `action_surface`, `permissions`, `policies`, `checks`,
`baseline`, `human_ack`, `risk_overrides`, and `organization`, and the leaf
fields `declared_purpose`, `prohibited_actions`, `owner`, `reason`, `expires`,
`approval`, `approval_required`, `authority`, `effect`, `safeguards`,
`confirmation`, and `idempotency`, all route to a human. Anything else — a
tool-source path, a project name — stays coding-agent work.

**`scan` is not part of this rollout.** `agent control` on a `scan` generation
reports `decision: null` / `decision_source: "none"`, exactly as it did before,
with a `reason` stating that the verdict is *withheld* rather than absent. A
scan pointer records no HEAD, no worktree overlay, and no input set, so no
artifact in that directory can show its verdict still describes the workspace —
editing the manifest, a `tools.json` it references, a policy pack, or a baseline
leaves the pointer reading cleanly. Publishing a verdict from `scan` needs a
complete, reconfirmable input snapshot threaded through report generation and
pointer publication; that is a separate change, and #323's scan half stays open
until it lands. `verify` is where a verdict a reader can check comes from.

**`shipgate.current_control/v1` is unchanged.** An earlier revision of this
branch added an optional `policy_snapshot_path` to `workspace_identity`.
`current_control_id` hashes the whole pointer with `exclude_none=False`, so
adding any field — even one nobody sets — re-hashes every pointer already on
disk and makes it unreadable by the release that introduced it. Nothing in the
pointer moved.

**Setup routes that changed.** `detect` hands a configured workspace to `doctor`
rather than declaring setup complete: it does not read the manifest, so
asserting completion from the presence of a file contradicted `init` and
`doctor`, which return `human_review_required` for the same manifest while a
declaration is unresolved. `doctor`'s emitted `verify` command carries both
`--workspace` and an absolute `--config`, because `verify` resolves a relative
config against the workspace it is given and the two composed into a path that
does not exist. `init`'s agent-mode error line carries the same selected route
as its stdout payload, rather than an independently composed one.

**Placeholder locations come from the parsed document.** The line scanner they
replaced tracked indentation, so the flow spelling
`agent: {name: bot, declared_purpose: [CHANGE_ME]}` — which the loader accepts —
was reported at path `agent` and classified as coding-agent work. Ownership does
not depend on how someone spelled their YAML. A sequence element is now reported
as `<field>[<index>]` rather than by its own text, so
`agent.declared_purpose.CHANGE_ME` becomes `agent.declared_purpose[0]`; the
`placeholders[]` field on `init --json` carries the new spelling, and `doctor
--json` publishes that field for the first time.

**`decision_source` constrains `decision`.** Each source admits only its own
engine's vocabulary (`release_decision` → the four release decisions,
`agent_boundary` → `allow`/`warn`/`require_review`/`block`, `setup` → the three
setup verdicts), and each operation admits only the engine that decides it
(`check` → `agent_boundary`, `verify`/`preview`/`scan` → `release_decision`,
`detect`/`init`/`doctor` → `setup`). Both in Pydantic and in the published
schema. Naming the engine was half the job: without this, a merge-authorizing
`complete` envelope could report `decision_source: "release_decision"` beside a
boundary verdict, or beside an arbitrary string.

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-invocation-spelled-commands"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — commands spelled for the invocation that emitted them

Runtime contract `22 → 23`. `minimum_control_contract_version` **stays at 21**:
the `AgentControl` union is unchanged, and v23 changes only how the commands
inside it are spelled. A consumer written against v21 control fields keeps
reading them unchanged.

**Every emitted command names the entry point that started the process.** A
console-script run emits exactly what it emitted before — `agents-shipgate …`
or `shipgate …`, byte for byte. A `python -m agents_shipgate` run emits
`<sys.executable> -m agents_shipgate …`, spelled by interpreter path because a
bare `python` resolves through `PATH` and can land on a different interpreter.
`AGENTS_SHIPGATE_CLI` overrides both and is parsed with the host's own rules
(POSIX `shlex` elsewhere, MS C-runtime argv rules on Windows, so a value like
`C:\Tools\agents-shipgate.exe` keeps its backslashes). `command` never contains
`__main__.py`.

This covers `next_action` / `next_actions[]` on every command, the agent-mode
error line's own `command` field, preflight signals' `related_command`, matched
trigger rules, and the control and repair commands the verifier and boundary
publish.

**`command` is a POSIX rendering on every platform, not a host-shell promise.**
There is one renderer and one parser, and they must agree — a string rendered
by one set of rules and parsed by another silently changes the values it
carries. Uniform POSIX quoting round-trips Windows paths exactly, because a
single-quoted `'C:\repo'` keeps its backslashes. It does **not** make the
string safe to paste into `cmd.exe` or PowerShell, where single quotes are not
quoting; nothing would. Recover argv instead:

```python
subprocess.run(shlex.split(command))   # exact on every surface and every host
```

**New on `next_actions[]`: `executable[]` and `args[]`.** A shell-independent
projection of `command`, runnable as `[*executable, *args]`. Both are computed
from `command` and ignored on input, and are recomputed on every read, so they
cannot describe a command the action no longer holds. They are **omitted, not
`null`**, when the command has no faithful argv form — a leading `NAME=VALUE`
assignment, or any unquoted shell metacharacter (operators, redirection and
therefore `<placeholder>` syntax, substitution, globs; only single quotes make
those inert). Every action that cannot carry an argv is therefore byte-for-byte
what it was.

`NextAction` is published with `extra="forbid"`, so these two properties are
**not** additive for a strict consumer validating against the v22 shape — that
is what this contract version carries. The model accepts its own serialization:
the pair is stripped on input and recomputed, so a round-trip validates and a
pair edited in transit is replaced by the one its command implies.

The argv pair is scoped to `next_actions[]`. The operational control contracts
(`control.next_action`, `allowed_next_commands`, verifier repairs,
`fix_task.verification_command`) publish the command string only, and
`shlex.split` is the documented recovery there. Extending the pair into them
changes the `AgentControl` union, which would raise
`minimum_control_contract_version` and force a down-projection for the frozen
`shipgate.codex_boundary_result/v2` schema; that is tracked in
[#369](https://github.com/ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate/issues/369).

**Durable artifacts are unaffected.** `report.json`, `report.md`, and
`packet.*` stay canonical: `docs/architecture.md` makes *same inputs → same
report* non-negotiable, and process entry is not an input. Published contract
vocabulary (`primary_commands`, `.well-known/agents-shipgate.json`) is
canonical for the same reason.

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-compact-control-envelope"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — the compact control envelope

Runtime contract `21 → 22`. `minimum_control_contract_version` **stays at 21**:
v22 adds a projection of the `AgentControl` union and does not change the union
itself, so every consumer written against v21 control fields keeps reading them
unchanged. The local downstream contract schema advances `9 → 10`.

New: `shipgate.agent_control/v1`
([`docs/agent-control-schema.v1.json`](docs/agent-control-schema.v1.json)), a
compact control envelope emitted on stdout by three commands. It answers the
whole routing question in one object — tool execution status, the release or
boundary decision and which engine produced it, the control state, the six-way
`permissions` vector, who acts next, the exact next action, and the
content-addressed path and hash of every artifact `current-control.json` binds
(`check` publishes no pointer and binds none) — within a published budget of
`agent_control_budget_bytes` (6144 as of contract v25, re-derived when the `confirm_declarations` route added a question list) — a measured target, not an enforced cap.
It is **not** written to disk, and it decides
nothing: every field is copied from a producer that already published it.

Three CLI changes, one of which is a default:

- `agents-shipgate verify --format control` — **added**. `--format json` and
  `--json` are unchanged and still emit the full `verifier.json` artifact, and
  agent-mode auto-detection still resolves to `json`. Flipping that default is
  a compatibility event and belongs to the command-by-command rollout.
- `agents-shipgate check --format agent-control-json` — **added**.
  `agent-boundary-json` remains the default and is unchanged.
- `agents-shipgate agent control` — **default output changed** from the raw
  `shipgate.current_control/v1` pointer to the envelope. `--format pointer`
  returns the previous output byte for byte. The pointer deliberately records
  no route, so a caller reading it still had to open the handoff to learn what
  to do next; the envelope joins the pointer's currency guarantee to the route
  the bound verifier already published. This command first shipped in
  `0.16.0b7` and has not appeared in a tagged release.

`verify --format text` now prints the control state, the next actor, and the
permission vector *before* the existing `Agents Shipgate verify: <verdict>`
line. That line, and every line after it, is unchanged.

Both entry points apply the same currency test. `verify --format control` reads
its own published pointer through the generation-safe protocol, validated
against the live workspace, and **withholds authority** when the workspace has
moved past what the run evaluated — a `--head` run in a dirty worktree reports
`human_review_required` with the refusal as its reason rather than `complete`.
The exit code is unaffected: withholding authority is not failing the run. The
route is read from the verifier bytes captured inside that protocol, so a
pointer can never be reported beside another generation's decision.

`artifacts[].path` is relative to the directory the command was invoked from,
falling back to an absolute path when the reports directory sits outside it. A
reader can open it exactly as given.

Terminal authority is constrained by provenance. A `complete` envelope is only
representable from `verify` (with a named `current_control_id` and a non-empty
`artifacts` map, decided by `release_decision`) or from `check` (with neither,
decided by `agent_boundary`); `scan` and `preview` cannot complete at all. A
`verify` route keeps `verify_required: true`. Both rules are published in the
JSON Schema as well as enforced in Python, so a schema-only consumer and an
in-process one accept the same set.

`verify --format control` reports only *this* invocation's generation: if
another run publishes over the directory while this one is reporting, the
identities no longer match and authority is withheld rather than borrowed. The
currency comparison re-observes the workspace after the pointer is confirmed,
so a commit landing mid-read refuses the pair.

`input_id` names the input the control was assessed against — the boundary
`audit_id`, or the verifier `request_id` — and the `complete` variant requires
it, so terminal authority can always be traced to its subject. `pending_review[]`
carries review obligations that survive a non-terminal route. Human-readable
output renders control characters visibly and keeps each field on one line;
JSON keeps the exact bytes. `agents-shipgate agent control` now reports a
*current but routeless* generation (a `scan` pointer) as an ordinary envelope
with exit 0 and merge denied, rather than exiting non-zero — a non-zero exit
keeps its documented meaning that no control identity is current.

Unrelated fix in the same change: `.shipgate/agent-contract.json` now upgrades
in place from any superseded managed version, not only from renders whose exact
hash was recorded. Repositories on local-contract schema 8 or 9 were reported as
`skipped_user_modified` and left un-upgraded.

Exit-code semantics are unchanged and now explicitly documented: the exit code
is the CI gate signal and depends on `ci.mode`. In advisory mode every decision
— `blocked` included — exits 0, and `review_required` has no exit code of its
own in either mode. `permissions.merge` is the only field that answers "may I
merge".

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-publish-vs-merge"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — publish authority is not merge authority

Runtime contract `20 → 21`, and `minimum_control_contract_version` moves
`14 → 21` because the discriminated `AgentControl` union itself changes. No CLI
surface changed. Contract v20 published the current-control pointer and the
refresh protocol; this note is v21, and the two are independent — a consumer
reading `current-control.json` gets the same `permissions` vector described
here, on every state, so the one atomic read answers "what may I do now?"
rather than only "which run is current?".

Under contract v14–v19 a human route was one universal stop:
`control.state: "human_review_required"` with `must_stop: true` and
`allowed_next_commands: []`. For an agent working on a pull request that
denied commit, push, and PR updates — the very actions needed to produce the
evidence a human was being asked to review. The gate was correct and the
workflow was circular.

**Human review now gates merge and completion, not publication of review
evidence.** Two additive changes carry that:

- `control.permissions` — an object with the exact booleans `edit`,
  `commit`, `push`, `update_pr`, `merge`, `report_complete`. It is fixed by the
  state *and the route*, never set independently. `merge` and
  `report_complete` always equal `completion_allowed`, and `must_stop=true`
  authorizes nothing at all. The converse does not hold: an
  `agent_action_required` route that runs *before* any diff was read
  (`fetch_base`, `install`) authorizes only its own `next_action`, because
  Shipgate has no assessment to stand behind yet.

  It is required only on `review_publishable`, so a pre-contract-20 payload
  still parses; readers reconstruct an absent vector as *nothing authorized*
  rather than defaulting it to "publication allowed".
- `control.state: "review_publishable"` — a fourth state meaning "a human must
  approve the merge, and the agent may still publish the change for that
  review". `completion_allowed: false`, `must_stop: false`,
  `stop_reason: null`, a human `next_action` pinned to `kind: "review"`, and
  `allowed_next_commands` carrying **at most one** command: the exact rerun
  that regenerates the same evidence against the committed refs. Both
  constraints hold in generated JSON Schema, not only in Pydantic.

  Publication is a claim about an evaluated, bound change, so it additionally
  requires all of: a subject `verify` can replay (a caller-supplied diff never
  qualifies), input the evaluator actually read in full, and — on verifier,
  handoff, and verify-run — a succeeded run carrying a non-blocked release
  decision. Those are container-level invariants, enforced in both Pydantic and
  JSON Schema, because the control variant alone cannot see the substrate.

`human_review_required` keeps its exact old meaning and is now reserved for
results Shipgate cannot vouch for: a `blocked` release decision, a `block`
boundary decision, a run whose execution failed, unreadable or unbindable diff
input, an undeclared capability surface with no discovery route, preflight
protected-surface touches, and MCP audit blocks. Those still authorize nothing.

Migration:

- Consumers that switch on `control.state` **must** add a `review_publishable`
  branch. Unrecognized states must continue to fail closed — treat them as
  requiring human review. The installed Claude Code Stop hook does this: it
  ends the turn on `review_publishable`, states that commit/push/PR-update
  remain authorized, and names the rerun command.
- Consumers that read only `must_stop` and `completion_allowed` need no change
  and lose no safety. `completion_allowed` is still false, so "may I report
  this done?" is unchanged; `must_stop: false` now means what it always said —
  some agent action is authorized.
- Legacy artifacts are unaffected. A payload without `control`, or a
  pre-v20 payload, normalizes to `human_review_required`. `review_publishable`
  is only ever produced by an emitter that asserted the publication fact.
- The deprecated `shipgate.codex_boundary_result/v2` projection stays byte-
  frozen: it omits `control.permissions` and renders `review_publishable` as
  `human_review_required` with `must_stop: true`, exactly as `pending_review[]`
  stays off that format. Use `--format agent-boundary-json` for the current
  contract.
- `agents-shipgate contract --json` gains `agent_control_permissions[]`.

**Every schema that carries a control advances, and the prior file is frozen.**
`control.permissions` is a new property and the published variants are
`additionalProperties: false`, so a payload emitted by this release does not
validate against the schema published under the previous identifier. Adding the
field without moving the identifier would have made one version name mean two
incompatible shapes, so:

| Schema | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| verifier | `0.7` | `0.8` |
| agent handoff | `shipgate.agent_handoff/v6` | `shipgate.agent_handoff/v7` |
| verify-run | `shipgate.verify_run/v3` | `shipgate.verify_run/v4` |
| shared agent result | `agent_result_v2` | `agent_result_v3` |
| agent boundary result | `shipgate.agent_boundary_result/v1` | `shipgate.agent_boundary_result/v2` |
| preflight | `0.3` | `0.4` |
| downstream local contract | `7` | `8` |

Each previous `docs/*-schema.*.json` is unchanged and remains a frozen
reference; artifacts emitted under those identifiers still parse. `verify --format
agent-boundary-json` and `shipgate check` keep their flag spellings — only the
`schema_version` string moved.

`shipgate.codex_boundary_result/v2` is deliberately **not** in that table. It is
a frozen deprecated contract and now has its own snapshotted control union
rather than inheriting the live one, so it publishes exactly what it always did.

Audit ids do not rotate. `audit_id` identifies the assessment, so the schema
token it hashes is pinned to the value established ids were issued under
instead of tracking the live wire version — a stored id survives an additive
schema bump.

<a id="migration-note-unreleased-diff-status"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0 — diff input health

Verifier schema `0.6 → 0.7` and trigger catalog `0.2 → 0.3`. That change did
not move `contract_version` (see the note above, which does); no CLI surface
changed.

`verifier.json` gains a top-level `diff_status` block that reports whether the
compared change set was actually read: `completeness` (`complete` / `partial` /
`unavailable`), a `reason` token (`not_attempted`, `refs_missing`,
`merge_base_missing`, `unrelated_histories`, `objects_missing`,
`metadata_limit_exceeded`, `body_limit_exceeded`, `git_timeout`,
`git_failed`), a bounded path-redacted `detail`, the
`remediation`, and `fetch_repairable`. Verifier v0.6 remains a frozen reference
and its artifacts still parse.

The trigger evaluator gains `input_status` and `evaluation_status`, and
`should_run`, `run_shipgate`, `skip`, and `skip_reason` become nullable.
**Consumers that switch on `should_run` must handle `null`**: it means the diff
was not read in full, so no verdict exists. Treating `null` as falsy is safe —
it routes to "do not claim this PR is irrelevant" — but reporting it as "skip"
is not. `next_action.kind` gains `"input_required"`; treat unrecognized kinds as
"no command is authorized".

Before this change, a shallow clone with no reachable merge base and a partial
clone with unfetched blobs both surfaced as one message, and the trigger then
evaluated the empty inputs those failures left behind and reported
`skip_reason: "no_match"` — "nothing in this PR signals a tool-surface change" —
about a PR the verifier never read. On a workspace without `shipgate.yaml` the
failure was not surfaced at all: preview routed to "Shipgate is not configured
in this workspace". Both are fixed, and a diff whose body cannot be read now
keeps the changed paths that were collected successfully instead of discarding
them.

<a id="migration-note-0-16-0b7"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0b7

Runtime contract `18 → 19` grades the LOCAL boundary stop. Under contract
v14–v18 every `require_review` boundary violation projected
`control.state: "human_review_required"` with `must_stop: true` — a
CLAUDE.md prose edit and a critical grant expansion were operationally
identical. As of v19, a `require_review` violation set that is entirely
low/medium risk projects `control.state: "agent_action_required"` with the
exact verify command, and the review obligation is carried in the new
additive `pending_review[]` field on
`shipgate.agent_boundary_result/v1` (each entry: `check_id`, `rule_id`,
`path`, `risk_level`, `title`, `reviewers`, `note`). The deprecated
`codex-boundary-json` format grades identically but its frozen v2 schema
does not carry the new field.

The graded band is deliberately narrow and fail-closed. These keep the
`human_review_required` stop at any scored risk: any `block` action or
`critical` risk in the set; `BOUNDARY-INPUT-INCOMPLETE` and parse-failure
evidence (unparseable content is not reviewable content — only the
parseable `unknown_host_config_key` case is band-eligible);
`CODEX-AGENTS-SHIPGATE-REQUIREMENT-REMOVED` (gate weakening); experimental
adapter surfaces; and every violation touching a gate-governing trust-root
class (`manifest`, `policy`, `ci_gate`, `shipgate_state`), which preserves
the composite-diff guarantee that a safe manifest append bundled with an
unsafe manifest edit still routes to a human.

The v14 control invariants are unchanged: `must_stop` equals
`state == "human_review_required"`, `completion_allowed` equals
`state == "complete"`, and conversation-level acknowledgement cannot clear
control state. PR-time `release_decision` branching is byte-identical —
the graded rows still land in `review_items` and route to a human at the
merge gate; only the local turn-level stop is relaxed.

The installed Claude Code **Stop hook** now follows `verifier.control.state`
instead of the release label: `complete` ends the turn silently,
`agent_action_required` blocks the stop once and names the one exact
remaining command, and `human_review_required` prints a hand-off notice and
lets the turn end — a Stop-hook block forces continued agent work, which
`must_stop` semantics forbid. Unparseable or unrecognized verifier output
warns, is never cached, and is never treated as passing. The cold-start
no-manifest case advises `verify --preview` instead of forcing
continuation. Reinstall hooks (`agents-shipgate install-hooks --target
claude-code --write`) to pick up the new behavior.

<a id="migration-note-0-16-0b6"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0b6

Runtime contract `16 → 18` lands in two additive steps. Contract v17 makes
verification identity and artifact closure content-addressed. A successful
`verify` now emits a verification plan,
decision-free unit result, artifact manifest, and terminal receipt. The
receipt is written last and binds the resolved Git subject, hashed inputs,
engine requirement, executor, assembled decision, and every referenced
artifact. Git snapshots use exact blobs rather than `git archive`; cache reuse
cannot change public artifacts; and expiry-sensitive policy evaluation uses a
declared evaluation date rather than a worker wall clock.

Contract v18 adds a fail-closed human-authorization overlay for one exact
coding-agent operation. A trusted host derives an unsigned
`shipgate.human_authorization_request/v1` from a validated prior receipt, the
current request/subject/decision/tree identities, and the complete ordered
review set. The host or authenticator — not Agents Shipgate and not the coding
agent — signs the request with Ed25519. Agents Shipgate ships no private key and
no signing/approval CLI. The corresponding trust policy must live outside the
evaluated workspace and be protected from writes by the coding agent. On
POSIX, its only lookup location is the OS account home's fixed path
`~/.config/agents-shipgate/human-authorization-trust-policy.json`; `HOME` and
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` are ignored for this lookup. The
request records the source receipt, artifact set, engine, and executor so a
host signer can require trusted-CI provenance or rerun verification. The
request-building command copies the receipt and artifact-set IDs from the
validated prior receipt, but later verify and execute passes do not transport
that prior closure and therefore treat those two IDs as signer-authenticated
provenance labels. They independently cross-check the engine and executor and
rebuild every operational identity. A content-addressed closure detects
mutation but is not an authenticity claim.
It exposes the evaluated base commit and merge base; the signer must review the
source commit's complete ancestry and reachable history, not only its final
tree. Guarded execution caps the serialized source graph at 512 MiB and 120
seconds, while the mandatory host broker remains responsible for tighter
resource quotas. The serialized-pack limit does not bound expanded-object
indexing memory or CPU; production brokers need a cgroup, container, or
equivalent host quota. Authorization-eligible plans require an exact effective
`plugins_enabled=false` mode, and the protected executor rejects enabled
third-party plugins before engine validation so plugin entry points never enter
the broker TCB.

A second `agents-shipgate verify --no-plugins --authorization <external-grant>` recomputes
the verification identities and accepts the grant only when its signature,
trusted principal, repository scope, validity window, request, subject, trees,
decision, complete review set, and typed operation still match. The v1
operation binds the exact evaluated commit, a canonical credential-free HTTPS
repository endpoint, one full destination ref, and explicit
`--force-with-lease=<ref>:<expected-oid>`. Synthetic PR merge receipts are not
eligible to authorize pushing a different parent commit. Only a
successfully evaluated `review_required` result can then project
`control.state: "agent_action_required"` with that one exact command. The
release decision remains `review_required`; `merge_verdict` remains
`human_review_required`; `can_merge_without_human` and `completion_allowed`
remain false. The one published command is the guarded
`agents-shipgate authorization execute` consumer, which revalidates the
receipt from an immutable snapshot, trust policy, clock, engine, repository,
and commit immediately before copying and fsck-validating the reachable Git
graph in an isolated store. It disables replacement objects, hooks,
configuration, and HTTP redirects before the signed push. Invalid, expired,
stale, or mismatched grants fail closed and publish zero allowed commands. If
the remote ref moves after approval, Git rejects the push because the signed
operation carries the previously reviewed lease OID.

This release defines and consumes the authorization protocol; it does not ship
a Codex, Claude Code, or other UI signing adapter. A host integration must
authenticate the human, keep the Ed25519 private key outside agent reach,
attest or rerun the source verification, present the complete request for
review, and return the signed grant. It must also isolate the trust policy,
launcher environment, interpreter, entire virtual environment and
`site-packages` tree (including startup `.pth` files), dependencies,
credentials, and installed distribution from coding-agent writes. Same-UID
file modes alone are insufficient; without a host-enforced
write boundary authorization stays disabled. Editable installs rooted in the
authorized repository are ineligible. V1 is push-only.

Report advances `0.33 → 0.34`, packet `0.11 → 0.12`, verifier `0.4 → 0.6`,
verify-run v2 → v3, handoff v4 → v6, attestation `0.4 → 0.5`, registry
`0.3 → 0.4`, organization evidence bundle v1 → v2, generated downstream
contract `5 → 7`, and safety qualification envelopes v3 → v4. New
verification-plan, unit-result, artifact-manifest, and receipt schemas begin
at v1. The authorization request, signed grant, verifier evaluation, and trust
policy also begin at v1 and share
[`docs/human-authorization-schema.v1.json`](docs/human-authorization-schema.v1.json).
Previous schemas remain frozen readers; they are not emitted by default.

`verify-run.run_id` remains for one compatibility cycle as an exact alias of
`request_id`; it is no longer independently derived. GitHub Actions evaluate
the immutable `${{ github.sha }}` by default. A default `pull_request`
synthetic-merge receipt carries no executable source authority; authorization
requires a separate verification of the actual PR head commit. Current Action
outputs include the validated receipt path and request, receipt, decision, and
artifact-set IDs.

The v1 portable protocol has one deterministic evaluate task. Workers validate
their installed engine and immutable transported inputs and emit normalized IR,
but cannot emit a release decision. The verifier remains the sole policy
engine; the assembler re-closes that decision over the supplied unit. This is
execution validation, not distributed scan/policy evaluation, arbitrary
sharding, or parallel speedup. See
[`docs/verification-reproducibility.md`](docs/verification-reproducibility.md).

<a id="migration-note-0-16-0b5"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0b5

Runtime contract `15 → 16` and report schema `0.32 → 0.33` make policy
applicability evidence explicit. Semantic claims now carry a typed evidence
basis and stable claim ID. Policy predicates carry tri-state status, effective
confidence, contributing claim IDs, and evidence bases; policy findings carry
a stable `support_hash`.

Rule severity, `block: true`, manual risk escalation, and rule-declared
confidence cannot upgrade heuristic, unknown, partial, or conflicting
evidence. Such applicability creates a non-waivable evidence gap outside the
Finding model and routes to `insufficient_evidence`. `--no-heuristics`,
baselines, suppressions, acknowledgements, and severity overrides cannot hide
these gaps. Strict mode emits exit `20`; advisory mode retains exit `0`.

Packet advances `0.10 → 0.11`, verifier `0.3 → 0.4`, handoff v3 → v4,
policy pack `0.3 → 0.4`, capability standard `0.4 → 0.5`, capability lock
`0.5 → 0.6`, lock diff `0.6 → 0.7`, action snapshot `0.3 → 0.4`, baseline
`0.7 → 0.8`, and the generated downstream local contract to schema `5`.
The safety corpus, receipt-index, and qualification envelopes advance to v3.
All preceding schemas remain frozen references.

Finding fingerprints remain stable because typed support is outside legacy
`Finding.evidence`. Baseline v0.8 additionally binds supported findings to
their `support_hash`; an older baseline can still be read, but it cannot accept
a newly supported policy/control finding without being regenerated and
reviewed.

## Migration Note: 0.16.0b4

Runtime contract `14 → 15` replaces the Codex-labelled multi-host check with
the host-neutral `shipgate.agent_boundary_result/v1` contract. The canonical
format is `--format agent-boundary-json`; `--agent` is caller identity only,
and every recognized changed host surface is evaluated regardless of that
value. `control.state` remains the operational signal and the minimum control
contract remains `14` because the discriminated `AgentControl` union is
unchanged.

The old `--format codex-boundary-json` spelling remains a deprecated `0.16.x`
compatibility projection of the same assessment and continues to emit the
frozen `shipgate.codex_boundary_result/v2` shape. It has no independent policy
or decision logic.

Host-grants inventory, baseline, and drift advance to `0.2`; the trigger
catalog advances to `0.2`; and the generated downstream local contract
advances to schema `4`. Report `0.32`, packet `0.10`, verifier `0.3`, handoff
v3, preflight `0.3`, capability standard `0.4`, and capability lock/diff
`0.5/0.6` are unchanged.

Zero-config means no `shipgate.yaml`, not proof of runtime-effective
authority. Repository scope is deterministic and default. The opt-in
`audit --host --scope local-static` reads only supported static local sources;
both scopes publish coverage and excluded sources. Session approvals,
invocation flags, UI state, remote managed settings, runtime enforcement,
agent execution, and tool behavior remain outside the contract.

## Migration Note: 0.16.0b3

Runtime contract `13 → 14` replaces independently derived completion, stop,
verification, and human-review booleans with one discriminated `AgentControl`
state shared by check, preflight, verify, handoff, MCP, verify-run, and GitHub
Action projections. Current consumers require
`minimum_control_contract_version: "14"` and switch on `control.state`:
`complete`, `agent_action_required`, or `human_review_required`. (Contract v20
adds `review_publishable` and raises that floor — see the migration note at the
top of this file.)

Boundary result advances to `shipgate.codex_boundary_result/v2`, verifier to
`0.3`, agent handoff to `shipgate.agent_handoff/v3`, preflight to `0.3`,
verify-run to `shipgate.verify_run/v2`, and the generated downstream local
contract to schema `3`. The corresponding prior schemas remain frozen
references; current emitters have no legacy-output switch. Report `0.32`,
packet `0.10`, capability standard `0.4`, and capability lock/diff `0.5/0.6`
are unchanged.

The control variants enforce
`completion_allowed == (state == "complete")` and
`must_stop == (state == "human_review_required")`. Pending verification,
installation, safe repair, and input recovery are coding-agent work, never a
human stop. Conversation-level acknowledgement cannot clear control state;
only a new verifier artifact can do so. `release_decision.decision` remains the
only release verdict.

Verify v0.3 also separates `execution` (`not_run | succeeded | skipped |
failed`) from `applicability` (`not_evaluated | verified | not_applicable |
failed`). `can_merge_without_human` is true only for a verified `passed`
result or a completed deterministic `not_applicable` skip. The Action adds
`agent_control_state` and `agent_control_reason`; its legacy control booleans
remain exact derived mirrors for one compatibility cycle.

The public Python models `AgentController`, `VerifierNextAction`, and
`VerifierHumanReview` remain deprecated reader compatibility surfaces for
frozen verifier v0.1/v0.2 artifacts. The retired `build_agent_controller`
projector is removed; verifier v0.3 derives control only through
`derive_agent_control`.

<a id="migration-note-0-16-0b2"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0b2

Runtime contract `12 → 13`, report `0.30 → 0.31`, packet `0.9 → 0.10`,
capability standard `0.3 → 0.4`, capability lock `0.4 → 0.5`, lock diff
`0.5 → 0.6`, and action snapshot `0.2 → 0.3` add an explicit static
agent-to-tool binding trust root. Extracted declarations now enter
`tool_catalog[]`; only tools proven reachable from the selected root enter
`tool_inventory[]`, actions, checks, capability facts, and locks.

`agent_bindings` declarations are exact, reviewed, closed-world evidence.
They cannot erase positive structural edges, and coding agents must not infer
or auto-apply them. Missing, partial, dynamic, ambiguous, or conflicting
binding evidence is unsuppressible and prevents `passed`. Pre-v0.31 binding
surfaces and pre-v0.5 capability locks must be regenerated before comparison.

---

<a id="migration-note-0-16-0b1"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.16.0b1

The tool-identity hardening follow-up advances runtime contract `11 → 12`,
report `0.29 → 0.30`, packet `0.8 → 0.9`, capability standard `0.2 → 0.3`,
capability lock `0.3 → 0.4`, lock diff `0.4 → 0.5`, policy pack `0.2 → 0.3`,
verifier `0.1 → 0.2`, action snapshot `0.1 → 0.2`, and agent handoff
`shipgate.agent_handoff/v1 → /v2`. The prior files remain frozen references.

Tools are no longer deduplicated by a name-derived ID. Each extracted
observation receives a source-scoped `obs_v1_…` identity and each canonical
capability a full `tool_v2_…` identity. Same-name tools from different
providers remain separate. Cross-source observations join only through an
exact, reviewed `tool_identity.bindings[]` declaration; invalid or conflicting
bindings join nothing and prevent `passed`.

One-to-one manifest selectors now accept `tool_id`, `provider`, `source_type`,
and `source_id`. A bare name that matches more than one provider applies
nowhere and becomes an unsuppressible identity evidence gap. A canonical tool
answers to the `tool_id` **and** the `source_type`/`source_id` of **any
observation bound into it**, not only its primary's — including the `tool_id`
each observation carried while it was still unbound: a reviewed binding (or a
`tool_inventories[].source_id` completion) must not silently rekey the identity
that an already-written row names, and Shipgate's own action scaffold emits
`tool`, `tool_id`, and `source_id` together. Both source qualifiers, when given
together, must be satisfied by the same observation, so a selector cannot pair
one member's type with another member's id. This rule holds for every selector
consumer — action rows, `policies.*` entries, and `checks.ignore` — not only
`tool_identity` resolution. Alias ids are for resolution only and never enter
the catalog partition. Finding
fingerprints are v2 and include the canonical `tool_id` instead of display
name. A v1 baseline fingerprint may match only when that legacy name resolves
to exactly one current tool identity; the old broad check-ID/name fallback is
removed. Reports before v0.30 and capability locks before v0.4 are not
identity-comparable and must be regenerated.

The built-in Conductor OSS workflow adapter additively advances the report
schema `0.31 → 0.32` by defining the required `frameworks.conductor` summary.
Report v0.31 remains frozen as the root-reachable binding contract. Manifest
schema `0.1`, packet schema `0.10`, and runtime contract `13` are unchanged.
`conductor` is now a reserved built-in `tool_sources[].type`; installations
with a third-party adapter using that source type must rename the plugin type.

`0.16.0b1` is a pre-release of the `0.16` contract line. It deliberately
tightens the meaning of `release_decision.decision: "passed"`: every in-scope
action must now have complete, conflict-free static surface, effect, and
authority evidence; all applicable controls must have been evaluated; and no
policy condition may require review. This is a conservative static-evidence
statement, not proof of runtime behavior or enforcement.

The runtime contract advances `10 → 11`. The versioned artifacts advance:

- report schema `0.28 → 0.29`;
- Release Evidence Packet schema `0.7 → 0.8`;
- capability standard `0.1 → 0.2`;
- capability lock schema `0.2 → 0.3`; and
- capability lock diff schema `0.3 → 0.4`.

Report v0.29 adds normalized semantic assessments to action and capability
facts plus
`release_decision.evidence_coverage.semantic_coverage`. Semantic gaps are
structured under `evidence_gaps[]`, but are intentionally not Findings: a
baseline, suppression, waiver, severity override, `--no-heuristics`, or human
acknowledgement cannot convert missing evidence into a pass. Any semantic gap
prevents `passed`; `unknown`, `inferred`, `protocol_default`, `partial`, or
`conflicting` required evidence routes to `insufficient_evidence`. Known
unscoped or ambient authority routes to `review_required`. In strict mode a
semantic `insufficient_evidence` decision exits `20`; advisory mode still exits
`0` while preserving the non-pass decision in JSON.

Every emitted v0.29 release decision makes the boundary machine-readable with
`static_analysis_only=true`, `runtime_behavior_verified=false`, and the
canonical `static_verdict_disclaimer`. Packet v0.8 §1 mirrors those values.
They are additive parser defaults for old artifacts, but current emitters must
always serialize them.

Manifest `action_surface.actions[]` now accepts reviewed `authority` evidence.
Agents Shipgate never auto-writes effect or authority declarations. See
[`docs/passed-verdict-contract.md`](docs/passed-verdict-contract.md) for the
complete pass contract and migration workflow.

Contract v11 also adds the stable `action_effect` and `action_authority` IDs to
`do_not_auto_assert[]`. Agents may route the corresponding evidence-gap next
actions, but these declarations are human assertions and must never be
invented or auto-filled.

The v0.29 report, v0.8 packet, v0.3 capability lock, and v0.4 lock-diff schemas
remain frozen references. Regenerate current reports and capability locks
before comparison; a pre-v0.30 artifact cannot establish current identity and semantic pass
eligibility.

## Migration Note: 0.15.0

`0.15.0` continues the `0.x` contract line from `0.14.0` with **no breaking
changes**. `contract_version` advances `9 → 10`, purely additively:
`verify_required` joins `agent_result_control_fields` and appears on the Codex
boundary result (and the shared `agent-result-schema.v1.json`). Consumers
pinned to `contract_version >= 9` keep working unchanged; a consumer that wants
the machine-readable check→verify deferral reads the new field. The
`report.json` schema is unchanged at `0.28`. New checks
(`SHIP-CAP-CONFIG-BINDING-REMOVED`, `SHIP-CAP-CONFIG-BINDING-CHANGED`) are
additive and only fire on dynamic-toolkit config bindings.

---

<a id="migration-note-0-14-0"></a>

## Migration Note: 0.14.0

`0.14.0` continues the `0.x` contract line from `0.13.0`. It is a minor
release that nonetheless makes deliberate breaking changes to the
agent-controller surface — permitted under `0.x` semantics — cleaning up
overlapping contracts instead of preserving every earlier surface. (An
earlier draft of this work was briefly labelled `1.0.0-alpha`; that label was
withdrawn because the report schema is not yet frozen, and the same changes
ship here as `0.14.0`.)

Breaking changes from the `0.13.0` line:

- `agents-shipgate verify` no longer writes
  `agents-shipgate-reports/agent-result.json`. Agents should read
  `verification-receipt.json` first, then `agent-handoff.json`,
  `verifier.json`, `verify-run.json`, and finally
  `report.json.release_decision.decision`.
- `agents-shipgate verify --format agent` was removed. Use
  `--format json` to print the full `VerifierArtifact`.
- Non-preview `agents-shipgate verify --config <path>` now fails closed when
  `<path>` is missing. The old lenient path could trigger-skip and exit `0`;
  the new behavior exits `2`, emits `merge_verdict: "unknown"` and
  `applicability: "unknown"`, writes only lightweight verifier/controller
  artifacts, and does not write `report.json` or run a head scan.
  `agents-shipgate verify --preview` is unchanged and still treats a missing
  config as an onboarding/relevance condition with exit `0`.
- `shipgate check --format agent-json` was removed. Use
  `shipgate check --format codex-boundary-json`; the output
  `schema_version` is now `shipgate.codex_boundary_result/v1`.
- The GitHub Action input `fail_on_decisions` was renamed to
  `fail_on_merge_verdicts`, with values from
  `blocked | human_review_required | insufficient_evidence | unknown |
  mergeable`.
- GitHub Action outputs derived only from `agent-result.json`
  (`agent_result_json`, `agent_decision`, `risk_level`, `audit_id`,
  `required_reviewers`, and `policy_snapshot_sha256`) were removed.
  New outputs include `verify_run_json`, `run_id`,
  `agent_controller_must_stop`, `agent_controller_stop_reason`, and
  `agent_controller_completion_allowed`.
- The runtime contract payload is now `contract_version: "9"`.
  It adds `primary_commands{}` so agents can discover the three prominent
  flows (`shipgate check`, `agents-shipgate verify`, and
  `shipgate audit --host`) without treating supporting/adoption commands as
  first-look guidance. `verify_local` remains in `commands{}` as a supporting
  compatibility command, not a promoted primary flow.
  Report JSON now uses `report_schema_version: "0.28"`. v0.28 moves
  policy-pack owner/reviewer/approval routing metadata to
  `findings[].policy_routing` so `Finding.evidence` stays limited to
  deterministic rule-match evidence. v0.27 remains the frozen schema that
  added policy-pack distribution metadata
  (`loaded_policy_packs[].{source,sha256,sha256_status,owner}`) over
  v0.26 evidence-gap rows and `suggested-inventory.json`.
- `agents-shipgate verify` writes
  `agents-shipgate-reports/agent-handoff.json`
  (`shipgate.agent_handoff/v1`), a compact projection for coding agents. It
  mirrors `report.json.release_decision.decision`,
  `verifier.json.merge_verdict`, and
  `verifier.json.agent_controller.completion_allowed`; it never computes a
  second verdict.

`report.json.release_decision.decision` remains the only release gate.
`verifier.json.merge_verdict` is the controller projection for agents and
PR automation; it is not a second release gate.

## What WILL NOT change in the current `0.x` line

### CLI command surface

These commands and flags are stable across the current `0.16.x`
contract line. Future `0.x` versions may make deliberate breaking
changes only by bumping `contract_version` and updating this file.

### Provisional CLI command surface

The org/fleet governance commands are preview surfaces in the current
`0.14.x` line. They are documented, deterministic, local-only, and included in
`agents-shipgate contract --json` / `.well-known/agents-shipgate.json` for
design-partner discovery, but their flags and schemas are not stable
command-contract commitments yet. They remain consumers of `verify` artifacts;
`report.json.release_decision.decision` is still the only release gate.

| Command | Preview flags |
|---|---|
| `agents-shipgate attest` | `--from`, `--out`, `--redact`/`--no-redact`, `--config`, `--org-id`, `--repo`, `--service`, `--tier`, `--pr-number`, `--workflow-run-id`, `--actor`, `--merge-sha`, `--verify-run`, `--event-time`, `--source-url`, `--branch`, `--base-sha`, `--head-sha`, `--ci-context`, `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate org status` | `--config`/`-c`, `--workspace`, `--baseline`, `--host-baseline`, `--as-of`, `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate org policy-packs` | `--config`/`-c`, `--workspace`, `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate org bundle` | `--config`/`-c`, `--workspace`, `--from`, `--out`, `--attestation`, `--registry`, `--as-of`, `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate registry ingest` | `--attestation`, `--registry`, `--repo`, `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate registry query` | `--registry`, `--repo`, `--org-id`, `--service`, `--tier`, `--actor`, `--verdict`, `--capability-id`, `--trust-root-touched`, `--policy-weakened`, `--human-ack-required`/`--human-ack-not-required`, `--human-ack-satisfied`/`--human-ack-not-satisfied`, `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate registry report` | `--registry`, `--bypass`, `--json`, `--fail-on-bypass` |
| `agents-shipgate registry summary` | `--registry`, `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate registry verify` | `--registry`, `--json`, `--fail-on-issue` |
| `shipgate audit --host` | `--workspace`, `--host`, `--json`, `--out`, `--save-baseline`, `--baseline`, `--drift`, `--fail-on-drift` |

`agents-shipgate feedback export` is introduced in v0.11 for design-partner
feedback loops. Its current flags are `--from`, `--redact`/`--no-redact`,
`--out`, and `--json`. Treat the command and `feedback_schema_version: "0.1"`
payload as provisional during the v0.11 design-partner cycle; the schema file is
published so consumers can validate it, and any incompatible change must bump
`feedback_schema_version`.

### Agent-Native Protocol

`shipgate check --format codex-boundary-json` emits
`shipgate.codex_boundary_result/v2`, the stable local Codex-boundary
control schema generated at
[`docs/codex-boundary-result-schema.v2.json`](docs/codex-boundary-result-schema.v2.json).
Agents act on `control.state` and `control.next_action`; `decision` is a
diagnostic boundary outcome. Human approval, policy
waivers, baselines, severity downgrades, suppressions, and trace evidence are
not agent-repairable authority gaps.

Full PR verification uses `agents-shipgate verify`. The single
agent-controller artifact is
`agents-shipgate-reports/verifier.json`; it leads with
`control.state`, `execution`, `applicability`, `merge_verdict`,
`can_merge_without_human`, and `fix_task`. `verify-run.json` records stable run
identity and input hashes for reproducibility. `report.json` remains the
release-gate artifact.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Pass — advisory mode or strict mode with no `fail_on` matches |
| `2` | Manifest config error (missing/typo/invalid) |
| `3` | Input parse error (malformed YAML/JSON, file too large, path traversal blocked) |
| `4` | Other Agents Shipgate error |
| `6` | Baseline integrity failure (v0.11+) — `agents-shipgate baseline verify --strict` detected `SHIP-BASELINE-INTEGRITY-MISMATCH`. Only the standalone `baseline verify` command emits this code; `scan` continues to use `20` for gate failure regardless of integrity-mode. |
| `20` | Gate failure. Strict-mode scan/verify: ≥ 1 unsuppressed finding hit `fail_on`, or ≥ 1 active unbaselined finding sets `blocks_release`. Also emitted by opt-in governance gate flags (v0.13+): `baseline status --require-owner`/`--require-expiry`/`--max-age-days` on violations, and `audit --host --drift --fail-on-drift` on host-grant drift. Without those flags the commands are advisory and exit `0`. |

### Runtime contract JSON

`agents-shipgate contract --json` emits the installed CLI's local contract.
Only the JSON form is stable; human-readable output is informational and may
change in any minor release. The command is local-only: it does not scan a
workspace, write files, call tools, perform network checks, or look up releases.

Stable JSON fields:

- `contract_version` — version of the contract-command payload shape.
- `minimum_control_contract_version` — minimum contract version whose
  `AgentControl` state is authoritative; currently `"21"`.
- `cli_version` — installed Agents Shipgate version.
- `report_schema_version` — current report schema version from
  `ReadinessReport`.
- `packet_schema_version` — current packet schema version from
  `EvidencePacket`.
- `capability_lock_schema_version` — current stable capability lock schema
  emitted by `agents-shipgate capability export`.
- `capability_lock_diff_schema_version` — current stable semantic diff schema
  emitted by `agents-shipgate capability diff`.
- `preflight_schema_version` — current proactive preflight routing schema.
- `capability_standard_version` — current capability standard version.
- `governance_benchmark_catalog_schema_version` — current benchmark catalog
  schema version.
- `governance_benchmark_result_schema_version` — current benchmark result
  schema version.
- `external_integration_surfaces[]` — stable non-gating integration and
  research surfaces exposed by the contract.
- `gating_signal` — always `release_decision.decision` in this contract.
- `agent_result_schema_version` — legacy local-agent protocol schema retained
  for compatibility with existing in-repo protocol and MCP surfaces. It is not
  emitted by `agents-shipgate verify`.
- `agent_result_schema_path` — checked-in JSON Schema path for that local
  legacy control object.
- `agent_result_control_fields[]` — ordered fields coding agents must switch on
  when reading the frozen legacy local-agent protocol.
- `agent_control_fields[]`, `agent_control_permissions[]`, and
  `agent_control_states[]` — current discriminated
  control contract vocabulary.
- `verifier_schema_version` — schema version for
  `agents-shipgate-reports/verifier.json`.
- `trigger_catalog_schema_version` — schema version of the published trigger
  catalog (`docs/triggers.json`) and, with it, of the run/skip verdict the
  evaluator emits.
- `verify_run_schema_version` — schema version for
  `agents-shipgate-reports/verify-run.json`.
- `human_authorization_request_schema_version`,
  `human_authorization_schema_version`,
  `human_authorization_evaluation_schema_version`, and
  `human_authorization_trust_policy_schema_version` — v1 versions for the
  unsigned challenge, externally signed grant, fail-closed verifier result,
  and external trust policy.
- `human_authorization_trust_policy_default_path` — the fixed POSIX
  OS-account-home trust-policy path; `HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` do not
  redirect it.
- `human_authorization_schema_path` — checked-in schema family path for those
  four authorization objects.
- `agent_handoff_schema_version` — schema version for
  `agents-shipgate-reports/agent-handoff.json`.
- `agent_handoff_schema_path` — checked-in JSON Schema path for the handoff
  artifact.
- `agent_handoff_artifact` — default emitted handoff artifact path.
- `codex_boundary_result_schema_version` — schema version emitted by
  `shipgate check --format codex-boundary-json`.
- `current_control_schema_version` / `current_control_schema_path` /
  `current_control_artifact` — schema version, checked-in JSON Schema path, and
  default artifact path for `agents-shipgate-reports/current-control.json`, the
  one atomic entry point naming the control identity that is current.
- `agent_control_schema_version` / `agent_control_schema_path` /
  `agent_control_budget_bytes` — schema version, checked-in JSON Schema path,
  and published size budget in bytes for the compact `shipgate.agent_control/v1`
  control envelope. The budget is a target that representative output meets, not
  an enforced maximum: a long `required_reviewers` list or an unusually long
  exact command may exceed it, and neither is truncated to fit. The envelope is stdout only: it is emitted by `verify
  --format control`, `check --format agent-control-json`, and `agents-shipgate
  agent control`, and is never written to the reports directory. It is a
  projection of the authoritative control state and never gates independently
  of `release_decision.decision`.
- `agent_refresh_triggers[]` — the boundaries at which a consumer must re-read
  `current_control_artifact` before acting. A control state cached across any of
  them is not authority.
- `current_control_fallback_read_order[]` — documented read order for consumers
  built before the pointer existed. Its absence is evidence of an older
  producer, never permission to act on a cached decision.
- `agent_read_order[]` — cross-artifact machine read order for coding agents:
  `current-control.json` first (`current_control_id`, `lifecycle_state`,
  `control.state`), then `verification-receipt.json`,
  `agent-handoff.json.control.state`, then `verifier.json.control.state`,
  `verify-run.json`, then
  `report.json.release_decision.decision`.
- `agent_interface_operations[]` — stable verification-operation vocabulary
  for the handoff artifact only. Authorization `request` and `execute` are
  entries in `commands{}`; they are not handoff operation enum values.
- `exit_code_policy{}` — stable machine-readable exit-code meanings for
  agent-facing commands.
- `mcp_tools[]` — read-only MCP tool names exposed by `agents-shipgate
  mcp-serve`.
- `manual_review_signals[]` — stable report/packet fields an agent should read
  when surfacing human review work.
- `primary_commands{}` — the prominent flow map for local boundary checks, PR
  verification, and host-grant audits. Values promote `shipgate check`,
  `agents-shipgate verify`, and `shipgate audit --host`; local verify remains
  available under `commands{}`.
- `commands{}` — compatibility/supporting commands for local `shipgate check`
  control, preview, default local agent workflow install, local verify, PR
  verify, and contract introspection.
- `default_paths{}` — default manifest, report directory, and local contract
  paths used by generated downstream agent instructions.
- `artifacts{}` — stable report artifact paths an agent should inspect first.
- `verifier_read_order[]` — ordered field path list for `verifier.json`.
- `merge_verdicts[]` — stable verifier verdict vocabulary.
- `release_decisions[]` — stable release-gate decision vocabulary.
- `do_not_auto_assert[]` — authority/evidence categories an agent must not
  synthesize to make a gate pass.

Package versions and schema versions are intentionally separate contract
counters. `agents-shipgate` may bump `report_schema_version`,
`baseline_schema_version`, or `packet_schema_version` inside a package release
when the JSON contract changes. Consumers that need a specific report or packet
shape should check `agents-shipgate contract --json` instead of inferring schema
support from the package version alone.

Signal paths use dotted notation; `[]` denotes an array field.

### Preflight JSON fields (stable)

`agents-shipgate preflight --workspace . --plan - --json` is the primary
proactive, static-only planning surface for coding agents. Legacy shorthands
such as `--changed-files`, `--diff`, and `--capability-request` remain
compatible. Preflight does not inspect runtime tool calls, start an MCP server,
or claim merge safety. `release_decision.decision` remains the only release gate.

The stable top-level fields in the v0.3 preflight result are:

- `preflight_schema_version` — currently `"0.3"`.
- `control` — the shared `AgentControl` operational projection.
- `workspace` and `config` — resolved workspace and manifest path context.
- `protected_surfaces[]` — canonical trust-root surfaces with `kind`, `pattern`,
  `scope_type`, `present`, and `present_paths`.
- `forbidden_file_edits[]` — standing whole-file deny-list for autonomous
  agents; this is not a general allow-list.
- `forbidden_actions[]` — shortcuts agents must not take to clear a gate.
- `required_evidence[]` — deterministic evidence requirements for a
  `--capability-request` high-risk action proposal.
- `changed_files[]` and `protected_surface_touches[]` — optional path review
  projection from `--changed-files` and/or `--diff`. A touch's existing
  `requires_human_review` flag may be false only for a resolvable, append-only
  proposal that adds valid built-in `tool_sources` coverage without changing
  any other manifest value or existing source row.
- `requires_human_review` — true when a requested protected touch requires
  pre-edit human routing or the plan lacks high/critical required evidence.
- `policy_snapshot_hash`, `trust_root_graph_hash`, and `trust_root_graph` —
  deterministic hashes/projection for policy and trust-root drift review.
- `policy_drift` and `trust_root_graph_diff` — populated when
  `--base-preflight` is supplied.
- `first_next_action` — compatibility mirror of `control.next_action`.
- `notes[]` — non-gating diagnostics such as missing manifest context.
- `signals[]` — deterministic rows with `id`, `kind`, `severity`, `actor`,
  `subject`, `path`, `reason`, `recommendation`, and `related_command`.
- `requires_verify`, `verification_command`, and `allowed_next_commands[]` —
  verifier routing hints only; they are not merge verdicts.
- `plan_summary` — deterministic counts for the supplied plan and resulting
  signals.
- `host_grant_drift` — optional host-grant drift payload when a host baseline
  is present or explicitly supplied.

Preflight distinguishes proposal authorship from approval. A coding agent may
author the exact coverage-increasing manifest proposal described above and is
then routed to `verify`; path-only plans, custom adapters, `trust`/`optional`
fields, source edits/removals/reordering, non-contained or symlinked paths, and
mixed manifest changes remain human-routed. The exception never asserts
action effect, authority, binding, policy, or approval evidence. The resulting
`shipgate.yaml` diff is still a protected-surface change, and committed
verification continues to require human review before merge or execution.

### JSON report fields (stable)

In `agents-shipgate-reports/report.json`, the following are guaranteed:

- `report_schema_version` — frozen at `1.0`. Bumps minor on additive changes; a breaking change needs a new major, which restarts the freeze. The `0.43 → 1.0` promotion was itself additive-empty: the two schemas are byte-identical apart from `$id`, `title` and this constant. See [`docs/report-1-0-contract.md`](docs/report-1-0-contract.md)
- `release_decision.{decision, reason, blockers, review_items, evidence_coverage, baseline_delta, fail_policy}` (v0.8+)
- `release_decision.evidence_coverage.semantic_coverage.{total_actions, pass_eligible_actions, gap_count, review_concern_count, reason_counts}` (v0.29+) — zero-tolerance semantic pass coverage. It is derived from normalized action assessments and contributes directly to the release decision; it is not suppressible or baseline-able.
- `release_decision.evidence_coverage.semantic_coverage.declaration_questions.{total, answered, open, open_by_dimension, open_questions[]}` (v0.37+) — the same action surface counted as a questionnaire. A *question* is one `(action, dimension)` a reviewed `action_surface.actions` row has to answer; only `effect` and `authority` are counted, and an action whose effect the scan established by itself never enters `total`. `answered` counts dimensions that gap when the same action is re-resolved without its declaration, so it can neither credit a declaration nobody needed nor be raised by restating what the scan already knew. `total == answered + open`, `open_by_dimension` sums to `open`, and `open_questions[]` is the answer order (highest-acting action first, `effect` before `authority`), joining to `evidence_gaps[]` on `(subject_kind, subject_id)`. Purely a projection: no branch of the release decision reads it, and its ordering cannot change a verdict. v0.38 restates the unit as *one blank a reviewer fills*: `open_questions[].answer_path` names the manifest block that answers the question, and actions answered by the same block are one question. `open_questions[].subject_kind` (`action` | `tool_source`) says which id space `subject_id` is in — an authority question every action of a source shares is answered in that source's `tool_sources[].authority` block, so it is asked, counted, and rendered once. v0.41 adds `open_questions[].authorable_by`, the conjunction of the same tag on every `evidence_gaps[]` row the question folds: a block whose effect the scan can propose but whose authority it cannot is still a human's edit.
- `release_decision.evidence_coverage.policy_gap_count` and `policy_evidence_gaps[]` (v0.33+) — zero-tolerance policy-applicability gaps for heuristic-only, mixed, unknown, or conflicting predicates. They remain outside Findings and cannot be suppressed, baselined, acknowledged, severity-overridden, or hidden by `--no-heuristics`.
- `release_decision.{static_analysis_only,runtime_behavior_verified,static_verdict_disclaimer}` (v0.29+) — explicit machine boundary for every verdict. Current emitted values are `true`, `false`, and the canonical disclaimer that the static scan did not execute the agent or prove runtime behavior, tool routing, credential enforcement, or safety.
- `release_decision.evidence_coverage.evidence_gaps[]` (v0.26+; semantic gap kinds added v0.29) — deterministic, human-routed remediation rows. v0.29 adds `incomplete_surface`, `missing_effect_evidence`, `inferred_effect_only`, `conflicting_effect_evidence`, `missing_authority_evidence`, `partial_authority_evidence`, `conflicting_authority_evidence`, and `invalid_semantic_annotation`, plus next-action kinds `declare_action_effect`, `declare_action_authority`, `provide_complete_inventory`, and `resolve_semantic_conflict`. Semantic declaration placeholders always carry `suggested_patch_kind="manual"`, `auto_apply=false`, and `requires_human_review=true`; they never enter `apply-patches`. v0.36 adds `declaration_below_inferred_evidence` — a declaration weaker than the (non-policy-eligible) evidence inferred for the same action. It routes to `resolve_semantic_conflict` and is closed either by raising the declared effect or by adding `action_surface.actions[].override` (`evidence` + `reason`), which keeps the action pass-eligible and records one acknowledged review concern. Each acknowledgement is also emitted as a row in `release_decision.evidence_coverage.semantic_coverage.acknowledged_overrides[]` (v0.36+) naming the action, both readings, the hint source, any source evidence that agrees, and the reviewer's evidence and reason — the packet's §1 and the PR comment render it, because a count is not a review surface. The acknowledgement is consumed by policy applicability as well, so applying it reaches the review route rather than trading one gap for another. v0.37 adds `next_action.observed_readings[]` (`{effect, sources[], observed}`) on effect rows — the distinct readings this scan's non-declaration evidence supports — and, where those readings support one conservative answer, `next_action.declaration_template` carries that answer **pre-filled** instead of a `<REVIEW_REQUIRED>` blank. A pre-filled value is a proposal, not an assertion: it is drawn from the closed `ActionEffect` vocabulary and never from source content, it is never weaker than any reading, and it is offered only where something was observed — a protocol default, or a heuristic reading of `read`, keeps the blank. `suggested_patch_kind`, `auto_apply`, and `requires_human_review` are unchanged, and nothing applies a template: only a reviewed edit to the manifest makes any of it operative. v0.37 also re-routes `partial_authority_evidence`: it is raised when the *source's* authority evidence is ambiguous or incomplete, and the resolver preserves it whatever the manifest declares ("reviewed authority cannot replace ambiguous or incomplete source authority alternatives"). Its `next_action.kind` is therefore `provide_source` with no declaration template, rather than a `declare_action_authority` block that could not close the row it was printed on. It is excluded from `declaration_questions` for the same reason. v0.38 adds `subject_kind` (`action` | `tool_source`, default `action`) to every row: a `missing_authority_evidence` row for actions whose source is configured in `tool_sources[]` is emitted **once for the source**, with `subject_kind: tool_source`, a `why` naming how many actions wait on it, `next_action.path` pointing at `shipgate.yaml#tool_sources[id=…].authority`, and a `declaration_template` that is a `tool_sources` entry (its `scopes` live inside the `authority` mapping, because a source has no sibling permission list). `next_action.kind` stays `declare_action_authority` — it names the claim being asked for, which no agent may assert on a human's behalf, and the contract's `do_not_auto_assert[]` is keyed on exactly that. Conflicts stay per action: `conflicting_authority_evidence` is raised about one action whose published evidence disagrees with the reviewed block, and only a reader of that action can say which of the two is wrong. **v0.41 adds `next_action.authorable_by`** (`coding_agent` | `human`, default `human`) — who may write the *first draft* of the answer. It is `coding_agent` only where the scan filled every blank in `declaration_template` **and** the gap kind is not one that asks a person to look again (`declaration_drift` restates a confirmed answer beside a moved pin and stays `human`, because an agent re-stamping the pin would close the request the row exists for). Such a row also carries `suggested_patch_kind: "declare_action"` and a `next_action.patch` that is *exactly* the template, split into the keys naming the action and the fields written — the schema rejects any other pairing, and `target_path` is relative to `manifest_dir` so the row reads the same in the packet, the SARIF file, and a cached base scan. `auto_apply` stays `false` and `requires_human_review` stays `true` on every row: the manifest is the trust root, so a declaration reaches the gate only through a human merge whoever typed it. The patch is outside `apply-patches --kinds` by default and is applied by the `confirm_declarations` control route that proposes it.
- `release_decision.fail_policy.{ci_mode, fail_on, new_findings_only, would_fail_ci, exit_code}`
- `release_decision.blockers[].{id, fingerprint, check_id, severity, title, baseline_status, blocks_release, capability_refs, capability_trace_refs}` and `release_decision.review_items[].{id, fingerprint, check_id, severity, title, baseline_status, blocks_release, capability_refs, capability_trace_refs}` (reference-only — both arrays share the same item shape; full Finding payload is in `findings[]`; `capability_refs` is v0.24+ audit metadata and is empty when no capability-policy subject matched; `capability_trace_refs` is v0.25+ local trace-evidence audit metadata and is empty when no local trace row matched)
- `capability_facts[].{id, tool_name, source_type, source_ref, capability, risk_tags, auth_scopes, owner, included_reason, control_status, related_findings}` (v0.9+)
- `capability_facts[].semantic_assessment` and `action_surface_facts.actions[].semantic_assessment` (v0.29+) — the normalized static claims, issues, conservative effect, authority mode, and pass-eligibility bit consumed by the gate. The action effect, capability effect, and assessment conservative effect must agree.
- `declared_intentions[].{id, kind, text, source, intent_tags}` (v0.9+)
- `misalignments[].{id, kind, severity, tool_name, capability_refs, intention_refs, finding_refs, policy_requirement, gap, release_implication}` (v0.9+)
- `release_consequence.{decision, summary, blocker_misalignment_count, review_misalignment_count, fail_policy}` (v0.9+)
- `suggested_scenarios[].{id, scenario_type, title, given, expected_control, source_misalignments, source_findings}` (v0.9+)
- `tool_surface_facts.{tools, scopes, controls, policies}` (v0.10+) — deterministic current facts used for static tool-surface comparison
- `tool_surface_diff.{enabled, base, summary, tools, high_risk_effects, scopes, controls, metadata_changes, policy_drift, finding_deltas, notes}` (v0.10+) — lower-level explanatory diff data only; it never changes `release_decision.decision` or exit behavior by itself
- `summary.{critical_count, high_count, medium_count, low_count, info_count, suppressed_count, status, human_review_recommended}`
- `findings[].{id, fingerprint, check_id, severity, category, title, recommendation, suppressed}`
- `findings[].tool_name` (string or null)
- `findings[].source.{type, ref, location}` (when available)
- `findings[].source.{path, start_line, end_line, start_column, pointer}` (v0.11+) — minimal source provenance for the common tool-source loaders (OpenAPI, MCP, OpenAI tool artifacts, Anthropic tool artifacts). Optional and additive: keys are emitted only when the loader populates them. Reviewers can use `path` + `start_line` to jump to evidence; `pointer` is an RFC 6901 JSON pointer into the source file. JSON inputs do not carry line numbers in v0.11.
- `findings[].agent_action` (v0.12+) — deterministic projection of `patches`, `autofix_safe`, and `requires_human_review`. Enum: `auto_apply | propose_patch_for_review | escalate_to_human | suppress_with_reason | informational`. The first four cover the actionable cases; `informational` covers suppressed findings or non-actionable advisories. `suppress_with_reason` is reserved for future check classes that explicitly mark themselves as suppressible — the v0.12 deterministic projection does not emit it. New consumers should read `agent_action` first and treat the underlying flags as advisory.
- `agent_summary.{verdict, headline, blocker_count, review_item_count, auto_appliable_patches, needs_human_review, first_recommended_action}` (v0.12+) — top-level deterministic projection of `release_decision` + per-finding `agent_action`. Lets a coding agent read one block instead of traversing arrays. `first_recommended_action` is `{kind: "command" | "info", command: string | null, why: string}`; the `command` form carries an actual CLI invocation, the `info` form is a "surface this to the user" hint. Same inputs always produce the same output; this block cannot disagree with the underlying `release_decision` and `findings[].agent_action`. Two narrower evidence-gap guarantees (v0.16+), stated at the scope they actually hold: (a) when `release_decision.decision` is `insufficient_evidence` **and** at least one `evidence_coverage.evidence_gaps[]` row is *addressable*, `release_decision.reason`, the short-form `Improve evidence:` line, and `first_recommended_action.why` name the same selected row and the same target or command; (b) on **every** verdict, `first_recommended_action.why` never says "no machine-applicable fix is available" while any gap is addressable. A row is **addressable** when `next_action.path` contains at least one character that actually renders (whitespace, controls, and Unicode Default_Ignorable code points render as nothing) **or** `next_action.command` is publishable exactly as authored — a command carrying any control, bidi, or invisible code point, or any whitespace other than U+0020, is suppressed rather than rewritten. Rendering escapes line-breaking and bidi characters as `<U+XXXX>` and never deletes anything; paths and commands are additionally never whitespace-folded. Outside (a) the three surfaces intentionally differ — on `insufficient_evidence` with no addressable gap the reason keeps threshold wording, and under `review_required` the reason stays severity-driven — so consumers must not infer alignment there; see [`docs/agent-contract-current.md`](docs/agent-contract-current.md#read-these-first-for-release-gating). `evidence_coverage.source_warning_count` stays the raw loader-warning count that feeds the `insufficient_evidence` threshold; rendered surfaces (`report.md`, `packet.md`/`packet.html`, CLI `--verbose`, `verify`'s fix-task remedies) group warnings of a recognized mechanism for readability without changing it.
- `codex_plugin_surface.{plugins, marketplaces, skills, apps, mcp_server_stubs, hook_stubs, mcp_inventory_files, component_path_issues, warnings}` (v0.13+) — static Codex plugin package and marketplace facts. Only explicit MCP inventory tools enter `tool_inventory[]`; apps, hooks, skills, and MCP server declarations stay in this surface block.
- `findings[].provenance_kind` (v0.15+) — records *how a finding was produced*; independent of `confidence`, which records how *sure* we are. It is a reviewer triage/filter signal only: it never changes `release_decision`, severity, fingerprints, baselines, or CI exit behavior. Use `agents-shipgate findings --from agents-shipgate-reports/report.json --provenance-kind keyword_heuristic,regex_heuristic,runtime_trace --json` to filter active findings by provenance class. Enum: `static_declaration | ast_extraction | keyword_heuristic | regex_heuristic | policy_pack | runtime_trace`. `static_declaration` covers manifest, MCP, OpenAPI schema facts, and declarative framework inputs like ADK YAML agent configs or LangChain/CrewAI inventory JSON files — high-trust structural data. `ast_extraction` covers findings against Tools parsed from user Python source by a framework extractor (LangChain function/structured tools, CrewAI function/class tools, ADK Python toolsets); these are subject to extraction error and agents that distrust AST quality can filter them as a class. Framework checks that fire against both AST-extracted and declaratively loaded tools (ADK's per-tool checks) pick the label per tool from `tool.source_type`. `keyword_heuristic` covers token-list matches (broad scope, read-only prompts, free-text parameter names); `regex_heuristic` covers regex matches (secrets, prompt injection); `policy_pack` covers findings emitted by externally loaded policy packs; `runtime_trace` covers findings derived from declared local trace artifacts. Built-in checks set the value via the required kwarg on the `tool_finding`/`agent_finding` helpers; third-party plugin checks that construct `Finding(...)` directly and omit the field are coerced to `static_declaration` by `annotate_remediation` so the wire schema stays satisfied. Required + non-nullable on the wire; the field is Python-Optional only so older v0.12/v0.13 reports loaded by `explain-finding` and minimal synthetic test fixtures keep working.
- `findings[].blocks_release` (v0.16+) — explicit release-policy blocking bit. Starting in v0.33, a policy may set it only when `finding.support.blocking_eligible=true`; rule metadata cannot upgrade underlying evidence.
- `findings[].support` (v0.33+) — typed predicate status, effective confidence, policy/block eligibility, stable claim IDs, evidence bases, predicate rows, and `support_hash`. Finding fingerprints remain unchanged; baseline v0.8 separately requires an equal support hash for supported findings.
- `findings[].capability_refs` and optional `findings[].capability_policy_evidence` (v0.24+) — capability-native policy evidence for built-in policy checks and policy packs. `capability_refs` is required + always present (empty when no capability-policy subject matched). `capability_policy_evidence` is nullable and carries the matched capability identity, effect, authority, controls, hashes, matched predicates, and source provenance when present. These fields are explanatory only: they are not finding fingerprint inputs, do not affect baselines, and do not introduce a second gate.
- `findings[].policy_routing` (v0.28+) — optional policy-pack owner, reviewers, and approval-routing metadata. It is non-enforcing reviewer/audit metadata: it is not part of `Finding.evidence`, does not affect fingerprints, suppressions, baselines, `blocks_release`, or `release_decision`. Policy-pack `match` predicates and `block: true` remain the only policy-pack inputs that affect findings and release gating.
- `findings[].capability_trace_refs` and top-level `capability_runtime_evidence` (v0.25+) — opt-in local trace/provenance evidence linked to `CapabilityFactV1`. Trace refs are required + always present on findings (empty when no local trace row matched). The top-level block carries deterministic summary counts, matched/unmatched trace rows, source provenance, and notes. It is explanatory only: it is not a finding fingerprint input, does not affect baselines or run IDs, does not change capability lock export/diff schemas, and does not introduce a second gate.
- `action_surface_facts.actions[]` (v0.16+) — deterministic current action snapshot: action id, operation, effect, normalized risk tags, scopes, approval policy, safeguards, evidence, input fields, and stable hashes.
- `action_surface_diff.{enabled, base, summary, added, removed, modified, notes}` (v0.16+) — reviewer-facing delta for what the agent can do vs. a prior report or v0.4 baseline. Policy findings derived from this diff can set `findings[].blocks_release=true` and affect `release_decision.decision` and strict-mode exit behavior.
- `release_decision.contribution_rules[].{finding_id, fingerprint, check_id, category, rule, rationale}` (v0.17+) — deterministic per-finding audit of how each finding contributed to the release decision. Required + always present. Exactly one row per `report.findings` entry, including suppressed findings. v0.33 adds `rule="unsupported_evidence"`, always with `category="excluded"`, for typed support that is not policy-eligible.
- `baseline.{matched_count, new_count, resolved_count, path}` (when `--baseline` is used)
- `tool_inventory[].{name, source_type, source_ref, risk_tags, auth_scopes, owner, confidence}`
- `loaded_policy_packs[].{id, name, version, path, source, sha256, sha256_status, owner, rule_count}` (v0.27+) — deterministic policy-pack distribution and ownership metadata for organization audit. `sha256_status` is `"verified"` when a manifest pin matched and `"unpinned"` otherwise. Hash mismatch still fails closed during pack loading; this metadata never introduces a second release verdict.
- `loaded_plugins[].{name, value, distribution, version, check_id}`
- `loaded_plugins[].{validation_status, validation_errors, runtime_errors}` (v0.17+ / M5; `dynamic_default_not_supported` added v0.18) — plugin validation provenance, required + present on every entry. `validation_status` is one of `valid | load_failed | bad_signature | bad_metadata | dynamic_default_not_supported | id_collision | bad_floor`; the two error lists are always present and empty for clean plugins. Invalid plugins still appear in this array (with `check_id: null` for entries that failed before metadata parsing), so reviewers can see what was skipped without reading scanner logs. Plugin findings whose `check_id` does not match the declared metadata are dropped at runtime and recorded under `runtime_errors`. `dynamic_default_not_supported` (v0.18+) rejects plugins declaring `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_METADATA.dynamic_default=True` — plugins have no path to wire into `core/dynamic_defaults.py`'s aggregator, so a swing check would never receive a manifest-effective default and would be silently bypassable.
- `policy_audit.severity_overrides_applied[].{check_id, default_severity, applied_severity, manifest_path, reason, tier_crossed, direction, expires}` (v0.17+ / M1) — top-of-report audit envelope for severity overrides applied during scan. Always present on emitted scans (empty when no overrides applied); required + non-nullable on the wire. `direction` is one of `downgrade | upgrade | same`. `tier_crossed=true` indicates the override crossed a severity tier boundary (critical / high / medium-low); tier-crossing downgrades require a matching `checks.acknowledge_overrides` entry, which is reflected in `reason`. `expires` is an ISO-8601 date carried from the matching acknowledgement (or the rich-form override entry); on/past this date the manifest fails to load with exit 2. Verify computes the hard-expiry date as the later of its wall-clock date and the content-bound `evaluation_date`; commit timestamps can never extend trust.
- `privacy_audit.{enabled, rules_version, sensitive_field_inventory_version, redacted_occurrence_count, redacted_paths, output_surfaces, notes}` (v0.18+) — top-level audit envelope proving the default-on privacy layer ran before public artifacts were emitted. `redacted_paths[]` contains `{path, count, kinds}` aggregate rows only; it never includes raw values or raw-value hashes. Redaction is best-effort pattern/key based and does not claim complete secret-scanner coverage.
- `reviewer_summary.{verdict, headline, tool_surface_changes, capability_misalignments, action_surface_changes, evidence_matrix_gaps, severity_overrides_applied, severity_overrides_tier_crossed, privacy_redactions, baseline_integrity_issues, first_recommended_surface}` (v0.20+) — top-level deterministic projection of the reviewer lens surfaces and audit envelopes; the reviewer-side parallel to `agent_summary`. Required + always present on emitted scans (mirroring the `agent_summary` contract). `verdict` mirrors `release_decision.decision` and is added/removed in lockstep with `AgentSummary.verdict` and `ReleaseDecisionStatus`. `first_recommended_surface` is `{kind, name, path, why}` where `kind` ∈ `{release_decision, lens, audit, evidence_matrix}` and `name` ∈ `{tool_surface_diff, capability_intent_diff, action_surface_diff, evidence_matrix, policy_audit, privacy_audit, baseline_integrity, release_decision}`; the pointer is `null` only when verdict is `passed` AND every count above is zero. The priority order encoded by `first_recommended_surface` is documented in [`docs/agent-contract-current.md`](docs/agent-contract-current.md). Same inputs always produce the same output; this block cannot disagree with the underlying lens/audit data.
- `heuristics_filter.{enabled, excluded_provenance_kinds, filtered_finding_count, filtered_by_kind}` (v0.21+) — top-level audit envelope describing the `--no-heuristics` CLI filter pass. Required + always present on emitted scans regardless of whether the flag was set (envelope shape is stable). When `enabled` is `False` the count fields are zero and no findings have been mutated by the filter. When `enabled` is `True`, every finding whose `provenance_kind` is in `excluded_provenance_kinds` has been marked `suppressed=True` with `suppression_reason="filtered by --no-heuristics"` BEFORE the release decision is built — those findings remain in `findings[]` for transparency but no longer gate release. `excluded_provenance_kinds` is the stable list `["keyword_heuristic", "regex_heuristic"]` (the only two `ProvenanceKind` values describing token/regex matches; `static_declaration`, `ast_extraction`, `policy_pack`, and `runtime_trace` are never filtered). The filter never un-suppresses a finding; manifest-driven suppression reasons are preserved verbatim when they overlap with the filter (the envelope still counts the overlap so reviewers see the filter's effective scope).
- `verifier_summary.{verdict, by_severity, by_reason_code, capability_delta_summary, protected_surface_touched, policy_weakened, human_ack_required, human_ack_satisfied, top_reason_codes}` (v0.22+) — top-level **composition** for the AI-coding-workflow verifier; the controller-facing one-fetch surface. Required + always present on emitted scans. Derives no independent verdict: `verdict` mirrors `release_decision.decision` and moves in lockstep with `AgentSummary.verdict` / `ReviewerSummary.verdict` / `ReleaseDecisionStatus`. `by_severity` / `by_reason_code` are active-finding histograms (the complete per-code map); `capability_delta_summary` (`{added, removed, broadened, narrowed}`) equals the `capability_change` member-list lengths by construction; `top_reason_codes[]` is the ranked top-five highlight (`{reason_code, count}`, ranked severity desc → count desc → code asc — the full set stays in `by_reason_code`). This block cannot introduce a finding-independent blocker.
- `capability_change.{enabled, added, removed, broadened, narrowed}` (v0.22+; semantic metadata v0.23+) — diff-derived capability delta projected over `action_surface_diff` / `tool_surface_diff`. Required + always present (`enabled: false` with empty lists when no base diff is available). Each member is `{id, direction, subject_kind, tool, action, scope, before_scope, after_scope, before_capability_id, after_capability_id, changed_hashes, semantic_direction, semantic_changes, risk_tags, release_impact, provenance_kind, confidence, rationale, related_finding_ids}`; member lists are sorted by `(subject_kind, tool, action, scope, id)`. A reviewer-facing projection — it never gates on its own.
- `protected_surface_changes[]` (v0.22+) — list of touched release trust roots, each `{path, kind, glob, related_finding_ids}`, sorted by `(kind, path)`. Derived from active `SHIP-VERIFY-*` findings, so every `related_finding_ids` entry resolves to a real `findings[]` id and the rollup cannot disagree with the gate. Always present (empty `[]` on a plain scan or when no trust root is touched).
- `effective_policy.{ci_mode, fail_on, suppressed_check_ids, waiver_scopes, severity_overrides, baseline_integrity_mode, baseline_fingerprints, ci_gate_present}` (v0.22+) — normalized (not text-diff) snapshot of the release-policy surface for base-vs-head weakening comparison. Required + always present. Every list/dict is emitted sorted (`fail_on` by severity tier rank) for byte-stable output; derived from the manifest **as declared on disk** plus accepted-debt fingerprints. `--ci-mode` / `--fail-on` override the run — top-level `ci_mode` / `fail_on` and the exit code — and are deliberately excluded here, so this block is a function of the tree alone and a base-vs-head weakening comparison never reads one side's invocation flags as the other side's policy.
- `human_ack.{required, satisfied, acks, outstanding}` (v0.22+) — declared human-acknowledgement state. Required + always present (default `required=false`, `satisfied=true`, empty lists). Within the static boundary, acknowledgement is declared evidence only — never inferred. A trust-root weakening (`SHIP-VERIFY-POLICY-WEAKENED`, `-POLICY-BASE-ABSENT`, `-CI-GATE-REMOVED`, `-BASELINE-OR-WAIVER-EXPANDED`) makes a surface `required`; `satisfied` only when a matching `human_ack` entry exists in `shipgate.yaml`. `acks[]` are `{owner, reason, affected_surface, expires, source}`; `outstanding[]` lists required-but-unacknowledged surfaces. The ack section lives in `shipgate.yaml` (a trust root) so adding one trips `SHIP-VERIFY-TRUST-ROOT-TOUCHED`.

During `0.x`, secondary projections are supporting/provisional even when their
field shapes are documented for additive compatibility. CI gates on
`report.json.release_decision.decision`; PR controllers use
`verifier.json.control.state`, `execution`, `applicability`, and
`merge_verdict`.
`reviewer_summary`, `verifier_summary`, `capability_review`, runtime
trace/evidence fields, Release Evidence Packets, and non-gating capability diff
projections are explanatory surfaces, not independent policy engines.

### Privacy and redaction

Reports, packets, SARIF, Markdown, GitHub step summaries, `explain-finding`
payloads, and JSON logs are redacted by default. The sanitizer runs locally and
does not upload artifacts. Redaction uses the shared rules in
`agents_shipgate.core.privacy` and the report-field inventory in
[`docs/report-sensitive-fields.json`](docs/report-sensitive-fields.json).
False positives are allowed in favor of privacy; local routing metadata such as
source paths, JSON pointers, and scopes remains structurally present with only
secret-like substrings replaced.

v0.18 changes public fingerprints for findings whose identity evidence contains
a recognized secret pattern because the public `findings[].fingerprint` is now
computed from redacted evidence. During `--baseline` scans, Shipgate also checks
the pre-v0.18 raw fingerprint in memory so existing baselines continue matching
without emitting raw hashes. After reviewing the v0.18 report, re-run
`agents-shipgate baseline save` to migrate the baseline to redacted public
fingerprints and remove the compatibility dependency.

### Severity-override floor

`checks.severity_overrides` continues to accept the legacy scalar form
(`SHIP-XYZ: medium`) and additionally accepts a rich form
(`SHIP-XYZ: { severity, reason, expires }`). Reviewers should prefer the
rich form for any tier-crossing or release-critical override.

Some built-in checks declare a per-check **hard floor**
(`CheckMetadata.floor_severity`). When set, a manifest override that
resolves to a weaker severity than the floor is rejected as a config
error (exit 2). The floor is hard — `acknowledge_overrides` does NOT
bypass it. Use `agents-shipgate list-checks --json` to inspect each
check's floor.

`checks.acknowledge_overrides[]` (v0.17+) — required for severity
overrides whose application crosses a severity tier boundary as a
downgrade. Stable shape: `{check_id, reason, expires?}`. Within-tier
downgrades (e.g., medium → low) and any upgrade never require ack.
Tiers (stable within `0.x`): `critical / high / medium-low`. Expired
ack entries are a manifest config error.

**Dynamic-severity check classes** (v0.17+; formalized v0.18). Catalog
checks whose emitted finding severity depends on user-declared
manifest values declare `CheckMetadata.dynamic_default=True`. Today
the only such built-in is `SHIP-ACTION-POLICY-VIOLATION` (emits at
`action_surface.policies[].severity`). Policy-pack rule IDs flow
through the same `extra_known_check_defaults` mechanism but live
outside the catalog. The severity-override resolver uses
`max(catalog default, manifest-effective default)` as the
tier-crossing comparison base, so a `severity: critical` action
policy with override `high` cannot appear same-tier against the
catalog's `high` default. The
`policy_audit.severity_overrides_applied[].default_severity` row
reports the effective (dynamic-aware) default so reviewers see the
real before/after.

Two contract rules pin the design (v0.18):

- Built-in checks marked `dynamic_default=True` MUST also declare
  `floor_severity` — enforced by a `CheckMetadata` model validator.
  A swing check without a floor has no safety net against silent
  downgrade bypass.
- Plugins cannot declare `dynamic_default=True` — the plugin
  validation pipeline rejects them with status
  `dynamic_default_not_supported`. Plugins have no path to wire into
  `core/dynamic_defaults.py`'s aggregator and so would never receive
  the manifest-effective default needed for tier-crossing comparison.

Adding a new built-in dynamic-severity check requires (1) setting
`dynamic_default=True` in `CHECK_METADATA` (forces the floor), and
(2) adding an aggregator overlay branch in
`core/dynamic_defaults.py:dynamic_check_defaults`. The seed loop in
step 1 of that aggregator auto-includes every `dynamic_default=True`
catalog entry, so the resolver's internal-consistency guard cannot
false-positive on user input that overrides a swing check without
declaring the corresponding manifest section.

### Scenario Suggestion YAML

`agents-shipgate scenario suggest --from agents-shipgate-reports/report.json`
projects `report.json.suggested_scenarios[]` into
`suggested-scenarios.yaml`. It is a concrete fan-out of the JSON report's
scenario contract, not a separate scenario engine.

Stable YAML fields:

- `scenarios[].{id, scenario_type, derived_from, finding_id, source_scenario_id, source_misalignment_id, tool, adversarial_goal, expected_control}`

Suppressed findings are omitted. Baseline-matched findings are included because
they represent accepted debt, not resolved risk. `adversarial_goal` text may
evolve in minor releases; the field itself remains stable. Rows follow the
source `suggested_scenarios[]` order, then sort within each source scenario by
severity, check ID, tool, finding ID, and misalignment ID.

#### `release_decision.decision` vs `summary.status`

These are **intentionally different signals**, kept apart for backwards compatibility:

| Field | Baseline-aware? | Recommended for release gating? |
|---|---|---|
| `release_decision.decision` | yes — baseline-matched criticals appear in `review_items`, not `blockers` | **yes (v0.8+)** |
| `summary.status` | no — any unsuppressed critical flips status to `release_blockers_detected` | preserved for v0.7 callers |

#### Release decision truth table

The classification below is the contract for how every active finding lands in `release_decision.{blockers, review_items}[]` and which `contribution_rules[].rule` (v0.17+) fires for it. Starting in v0.33, a finding with typed `support` is considered active for release contribution only when `support.policy_eligible=true`; otherwise it is excluded with `rule="unsupported_evidence"` before severity or `blocks_release` is consulted. Suppressed findings are excluded with `rule="suppressed"` after that evidence-eligibility check. Legacy findings without typed support retain the table's established behavior.

Notation: `fail_on` is `release_decision.fail_policy.fail_on` after `ci_mode` resolution (advisory → empty, strict → `["critical"]`, plus any explicit `--fail-on` override). `blocker_severities` = `{critical} ∪ fail_on`. `review_tier` = `{critical, high, medium}` (or any severity when `requires_human_review=true`).

| `blocks_release` | severity | baseline_status | severity in `blocker_severities`? | severity in `review_tier`? | category | `rule` | strict-mode exit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| true | any | new / null | n/a | n/a | **blocker** | `policy_block_new` | 20 |
| true | any | matched | n/a | yes | review_item | `policy_baseline_accepted` | 0 (with `--baseline-mode new-findings`) |
| true | any | matched | n/a | no | excluded | `policy_baseline_accepted` | 0 (with `--baseline-mode new-findings`) |
| true | any | resolved | n/a | n/a | excluded | (not produced; resolved findings are absent from the active set) | 0 |
| false | any | new / null | yes | n/a | **blocker** | `severity_block_new` | 20 |
| false | any | matched | yes | yes | review_item | `severity_baseline_accepted` | 0 (with `--baseline-mode new-findings`) |
| false | any | matched | yes | no | excluded | `severity_baseline_accepted` | 0 (with `--baseline-mode new-findings`) |
| false | any | new / null | no | yes | review_item | `review_required` | 0 |
| false | any | matched | no | yes | review_item | `review_required` | 0 |
| false | any | new / null / matched | no | no | excluded | `sub_threshold` | 0 |

**Why baseline-matched policy findings drop to `review_items`, not `blockers`.** `blocks_release=true` represents an explicit *policy* decision (Action Surface Diff rule, `action_surface:` manifest entry, or policy-pack rule with `block: true`) that the finding must block release **on first appearance**. A baseline accepts technical debt that already passed prior review — the project agreed to ship with that finding present. Treating baselined policy debt as a hard blocker would defeat the purpose of `baseline save`. The baseline-aware drop is symmetric for severity-driven blockers and policy blockers: both land in `review_items` once accepted into the baseline, both become hard blockers if newly introduced.

**Why `severity ∈ blocker_severities + matched + below review_tier` lands in `excluded`, not `review_items`.** A finding whose severity isn't in `{critical, high, medium}` (and which doesn't carry `requires_human_review=true`) has nothing for a human reviewer to act on per the v0.8 contract — it's been baselined and isn't severe enough to warrant attention. v0.17 records this in the audit so the (rare) edge case isn't silently invisible, but the `blockers[]`/`review_items[]` lists themselves are unchanged.

**Why exit code 20 depends on `--baseline-mode`.** `release_decision.{blockers, review_items}[]` always include the full set computed against `report.findings` (with suppressed excluded). The strict-mode exit code, however, is computed from `baseline_filtered_active(report, new_findings_only=...)` — when `--baseline-mode new-findings` is set (the default for the GitHub Action when `baseline:` is provided), baseline-matched policy and severity blockers are filtered out before the exit check, so exit is `0`. With `new_findings_only=False`, a matched policy blocker still triggers exit 20. The `release_decision` block remains baseline-aware in all cases; only the exit-code path changes mode.

Concretely: a scan with one baseline-matched critical and zero new findings produces `summary.status = "release_blockers_detected"` AND `release_decision.decision = "review_required"`. Both are correct under their respective contracts. New consumers should read `release_decision.decision`.

#### Evidence-only decision states

Finding blockers take precedence over evidence quality. If
`release_decision.blockers[]` is non-empty, the decision is `blocked` even when
the scan also has low-confidence tools or source warnings.

Starting in report v0.29, semantic evidence has zero tolerance. Every action
must carry a pass-eligible normalized effect and authority assessment. One
`unknown`, `inferred`, `protocol_default`, `partial`, `conflicting`, invalid,
or incomplete required dimension prevents `passed`, regardless of the number
of fully described actions. These gaps are recorded under
`evidence_coverage.evidence_gaps[]` and
`evidence_coverage.semantic_coverage`; they are not Findings and therefore
cannot be suppressed, baselined, severity-overridden, waived by
`--no-heuristics`, or satisfied by `human_ack`. A semantic gap routes to
`insufficient_evidence`; a known unscoped or ambient authority concern routes
to `review_required`.

When there are no blockers, `insufficient_evidence` means the static inputs are
not strong enough for Shipgate to gate release confidently. It does **not**
prove the agent is unsafe. The evidence is considered below threshold when
low-confidence tools are at least `max(1, ceil(tool_count × 0.5))`, or when
source-loader warnings exceed `3`. One to three source warnings without
blockers route to `review_required` so a human still sees the degraded source
coverage.

**Active high/critical findings take precedence over the IE label.** When the
evidence is below threshold *and* there is an active (non-baseline-accepted)
high- or critical-severity review finding, the decision is `review_required`
rather than `insufficient_evidence`. Both verdicts are
equally non-mergeable (`can_merge_without_human` is false either way), but
`review_required` points the reviewer at a specific, named finding instead of
the vaguer "we couldn't see enough." The evidence gap is **not** lost: the
underlying counts remain in `release_decision.evidence_coverage`
(`low_confidence_tool_count`, `source_warning_count`, `evidence_gaps[]`), so a
consumer must read those fields rather than the verdict label alone to know
whether evidence was degraded. `insufficient_evidence` still fires when the only
signal is weak evidence with no named high/critical concern; `blocked` still
takes precedence over both. The precedence is therefore:
`blocked` → `review_required` (active high/critical) → `insufficient_evidence`
→ `review_required` (other) → `passed`.

The intended recovery for a degraded-evidence case — whichever of the two
verdicts it lands on — is the structured action on the *selected* row of
`release_decision.evidence_coverage.evidence_gaps[]`: the first row whose
`next_action.path` names a visible target or whose `next_action.command` is
publishable as authored, falling back to the first row when no row offers
either (v0.16+; before that it was always row 0). For supported frameworks,
that action names the generated local inventory artifact and the exact
`<framework>.tool_inventories` manifest route, **including the `source_id` that
binds the inventory to the source the gap is keyed to**. An inventory referenced
without `source_id` is an independent source: its entries are added beside the
extracted tools rather than completing them, so the gap stays open and the
catalog grows — following the route without that field is not the prescribed
recovery. Only unidentified or unsupported source shapes receive generic
MCP/OpenAPI/inventory guidance. Apply the reviewed
evidence route and rerun the scan. When the decision is `review_required`
because of an active high/critical finding, also resolve that finding.
`agents-shipgate verify` keeps both cases human-routed
(`fix_task.actor = "human"`): a degraded-evidence case never opens an automated
coding-agent fix path, regardless of which verdict it carries.

### Check IDs

Once a check ID ships in a tagged release (`SHIP-POLICY-APPROVAL-MISSING`, `SHIP-ADK-GUARDRAIL-EVIDENCE-MISSING`, etc.), it will not be:

- Renamed
- Removed (only deprecated, with at least one minor-version cycle)
- Repurposed (the conditions under which it fires may *narrow* but never broaden in a way that breaks existing suppressions)

New check IDs may be added in any minor release. If your CI pins severities by check ID, expect new checks to surface as new findings.

### Check catalog metadata

`agents-shipgate list-checks --json`, `agents-shipgate explain <CHECK_ID>
--json`, and `docs/checks.json` expose `CheckMetadata.mvp_tier` for
display/triage only. Current values are `core`, `adapter`, `evidence`,
`lifecycle`, and `hygiene`. This field does not affect check execution,
severity, fingerprints, baselines, `release_decision`, or CI exit behavior.

### Static Python extraction

OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, and LangChain/LangGraph AST extractors share the
same runtime/context parameter skip list: `self`, `cls`, `ctx`, `context`,
`config`, `runtime`, `run_manager`, and `callbacks`. Those names are treated as
framework plumbing and are omitted from normalized tool input schemas. Google
ADK uses its own static extractor skip list: `self`, `ctx`, `context`, and
`tool_context`. For OpenAI Agents SDK sources, file and directory mode both emit
manifest-relative POSIX `source_ref` values; directory mode scans only immediate
`*.py` files in sorted order.

### Fingerprint algorithm

`fingerprint = "fp_" + sha256(check_id | tool_name | canonical_evidence)[:16]`

Where `canonical_evidence`:
- Sorts dict keys recursively
- Sorts list items by JSON repr
- **Excludes** the `default_severity` audit-evidence key (so applying `severity_overrides` does not change identity)
- **Excludes** the `source_provenance` evidence key (so adding local HITL provenance does not rotate existing baselines or suppressions)

Fingerprints are stable across runs on the same input. They are the identity primitive used by suppressions and baselines.

### Trust-model invariants

The scanner does not, under any circumstances:

- Execute or import user code (the SDK loaders use `ast.parse` only)
- Make HTTP requests
- Connect to MCP servers
- Invoke LLMs
- Send telemetry

The no-execute / no-import property is enforced by two complementary
tests on every CI run, not by convention:

- **[`tests/test_adapter_static_only.py`](tests/test_adapter_static_only.py)** —
  AST scan of every `.py` file under `src/agents_shipgate/` (v0.18+
  widened scope from `src/agents_shipgate/inputs/` only). The scan
  rejects:
  - Bare-name calls to `exec` / `eval` / `__import__` / `compile`.
  - Attribute calls to `importlib.import_module`,
    `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`,
    `importlib.util.module_from_spec`,
    `importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader`,
    `runpy.run_path`, `runpy.run_module`,
    `subprocess.{run, call, Popen, check_call, check_output}`,
    `os.system`, `os.popen`, and every variant under the
    `os.exec*` / `os.spawn*` / `os.posix_spawn*` prefixes.
  - Module imports of `runpy`, `subprocess`, `importlib`,
    `importlib.util`, `importlib.machinery`, and `builtins` — in any
    `import X`, `import X as Y`, `import X.child`, or
    `from X.child import …` form.
  - Wildcard `from os import *`.

  `importlib.metadata` is intentionally allowed: the plugin registry
  uses it for entry-point discovery, and discovery happens against the
  *installed* environment, not user workspace files. `importlib.resources`
  is allowed (v0.18+) at the import line **only** so name-aliases get
  built; every `importlib.resources.<attr>(...)` call site is forbidden
  via the `importlib.resources.` prefix in `FORBIDDEN_ATTR_CALL_PREFIXES`
  and must carry a per-call-site `ALLOWED_EXCEPTIONS` entry with snippet
  pinning. This covers `files`, `read_text`, `read_binary`, `path`,
  `open_text`, `open_binary`, `is_resource`, `contents`, `as_file`, and
  any future addition under the module — all of which take an
  anchor-package argument and could bypass the dynamic-import lint if
  left unrestricted. Aliased re-exports (`import os as oo`,
  `from os import system as sh`, `import os; import pathlib as os`) are
  resolved through union-of-bindings alias maps so a later import
  cannot erase an earlier forbidden binding. The lint runs as a
  dedicated CI step labeled *Trust-model invariant lint* before the
  main test suite so a regression is visible at the top of CI logs.

  **Meta-CLI surfaces (allowlisted, audited).** First-party meta-CLI
  surfaces are pinned **per call site** in
  [`tests/test_adapter_static_only.py::ALLOWED_EXCEPTIONS`](tests/test_adapter_static_only.py)
  by a four-tuple `(relative_path, surface, line, snippet)` where
  `snippet` is the canonical `ast.unparse` of the offending AST node.
  Each entry carries a prose rationale and pins a single call:

  - **`cli/bootstrap.py`** — one `subprocess.run` call shells the
    installed agents-shipgate CLI to chain
    `detect → init → scan → apply-patches`.
  - **`cli/discovery/artifacts.py`** — one `subprocess.run` call resolves
    the repository root with `git rev-parse`; one `subprocess.Popen`
    boundary incrementally drains the fixed `git ls-files` inventory under
    hard byte and wall-clock limits. Both use a sanitized Git environment,
    read repository metadata only, and never invoke a shell or fetch.
  - **`triggers.py`** — one
    `importlib.resources.files('agents_shipgate')` call resolves the bundled
    trigger catalog. Optional Git-backed trigger input delegates to the
    verifier's audited collector described below; this module has no
    subprocess surface of its own.
  - **`cli/verify/git.py`** — one shared `subprocess.run` boundary invokes
    local Git plumbing for exact base/head and working-tree orchestration,
    plus `pack-objects`, `index-pack`, and `fsck` to materialize an isolated,
    object-ID-validated snapshot. One shared `subprocess.Popen` boundary
    incrementally drains fixed Git diff, changed-path, attribute, inventory,
    and retained-manifest reads under hard output and wall-clock bounds. The
    bound is fail-closed: timeout, overflow, read/write failure, or an
    unexpected return code yields no trusted result. Neither process boundary
    fetches or executes user code; both use sanitized environments and list
    argv without a shell.
  - **`core/authorization_execution.py`** — one shared `subprocess.run`
    boundary consumes the fixed protected Git argv, and one audited
    `subprocess.Popen` boundary parent-streams `pack-objects` with hard stdout,
    stderr, and wall-clock limits. Both use a host-protected `/usr/bin/git`,
    sanitized environment, isolated/fsck-validated object graph, fixed list
    argv, exact force-with-lease, and no shell. They are explicit operational
    executor surfaces, not part of static tool extraction.
  - **`cli/fixture.py`** — one `subprocess.run` helper invokes local
    `git init`, `git config`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git update-ref`
    against a temporary bundled fixture copy so
    `fixture run ai_generated_refund_pr` can produce verifier artifacts.
    This allowlisted meta-CLI surface uses fixed argv, no shell, no network
    fetch, and no user-code execution.
  - **`fixtures.py`** — one `importlib.resources.files('agents_shipgate')`
    call to resolve the bundled fixture directory.
  - **`cli/discovery/agent_instructions/adoption_kit.py`** — one
    `importlib.resources.files('agents_shipgate')` call to resolve bundled
    first-party adoption-kit files from the installed wheel. Downstream
    customization is explicit repo-local file reading through
    `--agent-instructions-kit`, never dynamic imports or network fetches.
  - **`cli/trigger.py`** — imports `subprocess` only to catch
    `subprocess.CalledProcessError` from the shared
    verifier Git collector reached through `triggers._git_diff_context`. The
    `agents-shipgate trigger` subcommand issues no subprocess call of its own.
  - **`cli/self_check.py`** — one `__import__(module_name)` call
    validates that supplied modules import cleanly. Runs only under
    `agents-shipgate self-check`, never during scan.

  Per-call-site pinning means **adding a second occurrence of an
  already-allowlisted surface in the same file STILL requires a new
  entry**. Changing the call's argv shape (the `snippet` changes)
  also fails the test, forcing a reviewer to confirm the change is
  benign. The literal-anchor invariant for
  `importlib.resources.files('agents_shipgate')` is enforced by
  snippet pinning: a future `files(user_var)` call would not match.

  Three contract tests pin the audit trail:
  `test_allowlist_entry_matches_real_surface` (every entry matches a
  real violation on all four fields),
  `test_no_unallowlisted_forbidden_surface_in_scanner` (every
  observed violation has a matching entry), and
  `test_allowed_exceptions_pin_subprocess_per_call_site` (the
  multi-call files have distinct entries per call site, regression-
  testing the structural fix from the v0.18 PR #2 review).
- **[`tests/test_fixture_no_import.py`](tests/test_fixture_no_import.py)** —
  per-adapter live-load tests. Each adapter (LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents
  SDK, Google ADK, MCP, OpenAPI, Anthropic, OpenAI API, n8n, Codex plugin) is
  driven against a fixture whose Python content (or a sibling `trap.py`, for
  declarative adapters) raises `RuntimeError` at module load. Each test
  additionally snapshots `sys.modules` and asserts no module whose `__file__`
  resolves under the fixture root ends up cached after the scan — a stronger
  property than relying on the runtime raise alone.

If a contributor introduces a real need for one of the forbidden surfaces,
update this section in the same PR. The intent is not "we tried to forbid X"
— it is that X is *structurally absent* from the scanner's parsing path.

Plugins are off by default. `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_ENABLE_PLUGINS=1` enables loading; `--no-plugins` overrides at the CLI level. When loaded, every plugin is enumerated in `report.loaded_plugins`, and every third-party adapter (v0.20+) is enumerated in `report.loaded_adapters`.

Plugin validation (v0.17+ / M5). Every entry point is checked against five load-time gates before it can run:

1. **load** — `entry_point.load()` must not raise.
2. **signature** — the loaded object must be callable and accept exactly one required positional parameter (`ScanContext`); extra defaulted positional / keyword-only parameters are allowed.
3. **metadata** — `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_METADATA` must be present and parseable as `CheckMetadata`. Both `id` and `check_id` are accepted as the identifier key (v0.17 alias); newer plugins should prefer `check_id` for symmetry with `Finding.check_id`.
4. **id_collision** — the plugin's check ID must not shadow a built-in (including legacy aliases) or a previously-registered plugin.
5. **bad_floor** — `floor_severity` must not exceed `default_severity` on the same metadata block.

Plugins that pass every gate run with the same trust as built-ins. Runtime validation additionally drops findings whose `Finding.check_id` does not match the plugin's declared `id`/`check_id`, drops non-`Finding` items, and captures any exception raised during the plugin call into `loaded_plugins[].runtime_errors`. The scan continues regardless; `--strict-plugins` elevates any non-`valid` plugin or non-empty `runtime_errors` to exit code 4.

#### Third-party adapter discovery (v0.20+)

Third-party adapters register through the `agents_shipgate.adapters` Python entry-point group and provide a class (or instance) satisfying the `ToolSourceAdapter` Protocol — a `source_type: str` ClassVar, a `scope: Literal["per_source", "per_scan"]` ClassVar, an `artifact_class: type | None` ClassVar, and a `load(source, base_dir, manifest)` method returning `LoadedAdapterResult`. Discovery is gated by the same `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_ENABLE_PLUGINS=1` env var as plugin checks; `--no-plugins` forces it off.

Every discovered entry point is checked against four load-time gates before it can register on the scan's adapter registry:

1. **load** — `entry_point.load()` must not raise. Captured as `validation_status="load_failed"`.
2. **bad_protocol** — the loaded value (a class is instantiated with no args; an instance is used directly) must have all three ClassVars (`source_type` non-empty string, `scope`, `artifact_class`) and a callable `load` method that accepts the three positional arguments `(source, base_dir, manifest)`: at least three positional slots (or `*args`), no more than three required positional parameters, and no required keyword-only parameters. Captured as `validation_status="bad_protocol"`.
3. **bad_scope** — `scope` must be exactly `"per_source"` or `"per_scan"`. Out-of-range values would be silently skipped by the dispatcher. Captured as `validation_status="bad_scope"`.
4. **source_type_collision** — the adapter's `source_type` must not shadow a built-in (`mcp`, `openapi`, `langchain`, etc.) or another third-party adapter discovered earlier in the same scan. **This is the load-bearing trust rule** — without it, a malicious plugin could displace a built-in adapter and intercept every scan targeting that source type. Captured as `validation_status="source_type_collision"`.

**Per-scan registry contract.** Adapters that pass every gate register on a **per-scan clone** of the global `REGISTRY` (built at the start of each `run_scan` / `inspect_sources` via `AdapterRegistry.clone()`), NOT on the global itself. The global stays builtin-only across the lifetime of the process. This guarantees two trust invariants:

- **`--no-plugins` is per-scan honest.** A later in-process scan with `plugins_enabled=False` sees a fresh builtin-only clone — no third-party adapters carried over from a prior enabled scan.
- **Collision detection is per-scan honest.** The collision set is the clone's builtins-only state, so two consecutive scans of the same valid third-party adapter both classify as `validation_status="valid"`, never as `source_type_collision` against the adapter's own previous registration.

The dispatcher walks the per-scan registry in the same pass-1 (per-source, in `tool_sources[]` declared order) / pass-2 (per-scan, in canonical registry order) loops it uses for built-ins. Two trust mechanisms protect the dispatch path:

- **Artifact-class smuggling prevention.** The dispatcher's `_absorb` step fires `TypeError` if any adapter (built-in or third-party) declares one `artifact_class` but returns an artifact of another type. This is the structural counterpart to the `Finding.check_id` smuggling rule for plugin checks.
- **Runtime-error capture for third-party adapters.** Third-party adapters that raise at runtime do NOT abort the scan. The dispatcher routes their `load()` call through `run_validated_adapter` (from `inputs/adapter_validation.py`), which catches every exception, captures it into `loaded_adapters[].runtime_errors` on the matching row, and signals the dispatcher to skip absorbing the (None) result. Built-in adapters keep the direct call shape — a built-in raising means the scanner itself is broken and must abort loudly.

`doctor` (`inspect_sources`) uses the same per-scan registry clone + discovery + dispatcher path as `scan`, so manifests referencing third-party `tool_sources[].type` values are introspectable. The doctor payload surfaces `loaded_adapters[]` alongside the existing `policy_packs` field.

`--strict-plugins` (v0.17+) covers BOTH plugin and adapter failures from v0.20+ — any non-`valid` `loaded_plugins[]` row, any non-empty `loaded_plugins[].runtime_errors`, any non-`valid` `loaded_adapters[]` row, OR any non-empty `loaded_adapters[].runtime_errors` elevates the scan to exit code 4. Default behavior remains lenient — failures are recorded in the respective provenance arrays and the scan proceeds.

**Manifest `tool_sources[].type`.** The field is `str` (relaxed from a closed `Literal` in v0.20) so manifests can reference third-party per-source adapters by name. Built-in source types are enumerated in `BUILTIN_TOOL_SOURCE_TYPES` for documentation and tooling; per-scan-only built-ins (`n8n`, `openai_api`, `anthropic_api`, `validation`) are still rejected at manifest-load time with a routable error pointing the user to the dedicated top-level manifest section. Unknown source types — both genuine third-party names with no registered adapter and typos of built-in names — fail with `ConfigError` (exit 2) when the dispatcher's `AdapterRegistry.require` cannot resolve them. The exit-2 contract is unchanged from prior releases; the failure layer (manifest-load vs dispatch) may differ.

### Manifest Schema

The manifest schema version (`version: "0.1"`) is independent of the CLI
version and package version. Manifest schema changes follow their own
deprecation cycle, and the manifest loader is intentionally strict: older CLIs
reject unknown top-level fields instead of silently ignoring release policy.
Manifests that use `action_surface:` require a CLI whose
`agents-shipgate contract --json` reports `report_schema_version >= 0.16`.

`tool_sources[].authority` (`{mode, auth_type, credential_mode, scopes, reason}`)
is additive and requires `report_schema_version >= 0.38`. It declares one
reviewed authority for every action the source contributes; an
`action_surface.actions[]` row that declares its own `authority` overrides it
for that action. Both sites share one set of mode co-requirements and one
conflict rule against published source evidence, and existing manifests are
unaffected — a source with no `authority` block resolves exactly as before.

`tool_sources[].binding` (`{complete: true, reason}`) is additive and changes
no published schema, so there is no `report_schema_version` floor to check for
it. A CLI that predates the field *rejects* it — the manifest loader is strict,
so the run stops with a routable `ConfigError` (exit 2) naming the unknown key
rather than ignoring a reviewed claim. It declares that every tool the source
contributes is part of the surface under review, which is what a tool server
publishing its own `tools/list` asserts; the effect is only ever to widen the
analysed surface, and a source with no `binding` block resolves exactly as
before. It does not replace `agent_bindings.declarations`, which remains the
way an agent declares the subset of a catalog it wires.

`policies.control_pack` (`default` | `financial-strict` | `read-only-agent`)
is additive and changes no published schema, so there is no
`report_schema_version` floor to check for it. A CLI that predates the field
*rejects* it — the manifest loader is strict, so the run stops with a routable
`ConfigError` (exit 2) naming the unknown key rather than ignoring a release
rule. To detect support before writing it, read `control_pack.available` from
`agents-shipgate init --json`; a CLI without control packs emits no
`control_pack` key at all. It selects which controls
each action effect requires. Omitting it means `default`, which is exactly the
rule set every prior release applied, so existing manifests keep their
verdicts. Every built-in pack requires at least what `default` requires — a
pack can add obligations and can never drop one — so a report that passes
under any pack would also have passed under `default`. Selecting a pack does
not change what a *declaration* means: the obligation lattice deciding whether
a declared effect covers an inferred one stays the built-in table.

Obligations for effects with no dedicated control check (`write`,
`privileged_data_access`, `identity_access`) are reported through
`SHIP-ACTION-POLICY-VIOLATION` at `high`, with the rule named in
`findings[].evidence.policy_id` as `control-pack:<effects>` (effects joined by
`+` where one rule covers several). The pack name is deliberately **not** in
that id: `policy_id` is a fingerprint input, and two packs requiring the same
controls for the same effect state one rule, so naming the pack would re-open
a baseline entry on a move that changed nothing. `control-pack:` is a reserved
prefix — `action_surface.policies[].id` rejects it at manifest load, the same
way `SHIP-` is reserved for built-in check ids.

Like the four dedicated control families, these are mandatory current-surface
controls: a `checks.ignore` entry records the exception without waiving the
blocker. That is decided from `findings[].evidence.control_pack`, which only
the engine writes, and never from the `policy_id` string alone.

`effective_policy.control_pack` (v0.40+) publishes the pack in force, so a
base-vs-head comparison can see the gate weakened by a *rule* change and not
only by a severity one. `SHIP-VERIFY-POLICY-WEAKENED` gains
`kind: control_pack_weakened`: one finding per pack move, carrying
`removed_controls[] = {effect, controls}` for every effect the head pack
requires less of. A snapshot with no `control_pack` predates the field and is
compared as `default` — a build without control packs could not have loaded a
manifest naming one. A snapshot naming a pack this build cannot resolve is a
different case and is not read as "no weakening": it routes to
`SHIP-VERIFY-POLICY-BASE-ABSENT` with `kind: control_pack_unrecognized`, the
reason code that says the comparison could not be made.

Control findings carry `findings[].evidence.control_pack` and
`findings[].evidence.control_effects` (the effects the rule actually matched,
not its whole category). Both are excluded from the finding fingerprint, so a
baseline recorded before the fields keeps matching.

`run_id` covers the pack's **id, version, and canonical obligations**: two
manifests selecting different packs enforce different policy and are different
runs, including where neither produces a control finding, and a release that
changes what `default` requires moves it too.

Moving to a stricter pack changes the `missing` list of a control finding
whose requirements grew, and therefore its fingerprint — a baseline entry that
accepted the narrower gap stops matching and the finding re-opens. A move
between two packs that require the *same* controls for an effect re-opens
nothing, because the rule did not change.

### Baseline Integrity (v0.5)

Baseline schema bumps to `0.5`. The wire shape adds an optional
`findings[].provenance` block per entry recording when and by which scanner
the entry was added:

```json
{
  "fingerprint": "fp_…",
  "check_id": "SHIP-…",
  "tool_name": "…",
  "severity": "high",
  "title": "…",
  "provenance": {
    "scanner_version": "0.13.0",
    "run_id": "agents_shipgate_…",
    "recorded_at": "2026-05-15T14:23:00Z",
    "reason": null,
    "expires": null
  }
}
```

`provenance` is optional on the wire so older v0.2/v0.3/v0.4 baselines still
load. The integrity check flags legacy-no-provenance entries as
`SHIP-BASELINE-INTEGRITY-MISMATCH` until they are re-stamped by re-running
`agents-shipgate baseline save`. `provenance.reason` and `provenance.expires`
are reviewer-set and free-form / ISO-8601 date respectively.

Each `agents-shipgate baseline save` appends one JSON line to
`<baseline-dir>/baseline-audit.log`. The log row is **stable**:

- `audit_schema_version: "0.1"`
- `timestamp` — ISO-8601 UTC
- `run_id` — scan's run_id (matches `BaselineProvenance.run_id` for any
  fingerprints added in this save)
- `scanner_version` — Agents Shipgate version that wrote the row
- `baseline_path` — string path saved at the time of the row
- `hash_before` — `"sha256:…"` of the prior baseline file content, or `null`
  when this was the first save
- `hash_after` — `"sha256:…"` of the new baseline file content
- `added_fingerprints[]`, `removed_fingerprints[]` — sorted deltas

The audit log is append-only and intentionally co-located with the baseline so
a single `.agents-shipgate/` directory carries both. Commit both files
together; reviewers can `git log .agents-shipgate/baseline-audit.log` to see
when fingerprints joined the baseline.

`manifest.baseline.integrity_mode` controls behavior when `scan --baseline X`
detects an integrity issue. Stable values:

- `off` — no integrity checks. Back-compat escape hatch for repos that have
  not migrated to v0.5 baselines yet.
- `warn` (default in v0.11) — integrity findings emitted but
  `blocks_release: false`; release decision is unaffected.
- `strict` — `SHIP-BASELINE-INTEGRITY-MISMATCH` carries
  `blocks_release: true` and `agents-shipgate baseline verify` exits `6` on
  the same condition.

New stable check IDs (v0.11+):

- `SHIP-BASELINE-INTEGRITY-MISMATCH` (critical) — file hash mismatch, missing
  audit log, audit log empty or malformed, entry references unknown `run_id`,
  or entry loaded from a legacy schema without provenance.
- `SHIP-BASELINE-ENTRY-EXPIRED` (high) — `provenance.expires` < today.
- `SHIP-BASELINE-ENTRY-STALE` (low) — deprecated check ID in the entry, or
  the entry matched no active finding (scan-aware; resolved-not-pruned).

Integrity findings bypass `checks.ignore` (suppression) and
`checks.severity_overrides`. Silencing tamper detection would defeat the
trust property the audit log defends. They flow through the regular report
pipeline otherwise (fingerprinting, baseline-status assignment, remediation
annotation).

The audit log is **tamper-evident, not tamper-proof**: a well-resourced
adversary who atomically rewrites both the baseline JSON and the audit log
defeats `verify`. The goal is to make casual or accidental edits observably
wrong in code review.

### Verify Orchestrator

`agents-shipgate verify` is the canonical ongoing-PR command. It evaluates the
published trigger catalog against the local diff, optionally scans a locally
available base tree into an isolated temporary directory, and then runs exactly
one authoritative head scan. When `--head` is provided, the head scan uses an
isolated archive of that ref; when omitted, it scans the checked-out workspace.
`report.json.release_decision.decision` remains the only release gate;
`verifier.json` is an orchestration artifact.

`verify` never fetches. Callers that want base diff enrichment must make the
base ref available before invoking the command, for example with
`actions/checkout` `fetch-depth: 0` or an explicit `git fetch origin <base>` in
CI. If the requested base ref or PR diff context is unavailable, verify records
`base_status` in `verifier.json`, skips a head-only scan, emits
`merge_verdict: "unknown"`, and exits 2. If the base tree is available but the
base manifest or base scan is unavailable, verify records `base_status`, disables
diff enrichment, and leaves the head release decision and exit code unchanged.

Before any trigger-skip can return success, non-preview `verify` also requires
the resolved `--config` path to exist. A missing config is a configuration
failure, not a docs-only or no-trigger success: verify writes `verifier.json`,
`verify-run.json`, `agent-handoff.json`, and `pr-comment.md` with
`head_status: "failed"`, `head_exit_code: 2`, `merge_verdict: "unknown"`,
`execution: "failed"`, `applicability: "failed"`,
`control.state: "agent_action_required"`, and
`can_merge_without_human: false`; it writes no
`report.json` and runs no head scan. The first next action directs agents to
fix the config path or run `agents-shipgate verify --preview --json` before
initializing.

The head scan writes `report.md`, `report.json`, `report.sarif`, `packet.json`,
`verifier.json`, `verify-run.json`, `agent-handoff.json`, `pr-comment.md`,
`verification-plan.json`, `verification-unit-result.json`,
`verification-artifacts.json`, and, last, `verification-receipt.json`.
`verify` intentionally requests packet
JSON only, regardless of manifest `output.packet.formats`; `pr-comment.md` is
the human PR surface. Use `agents-shipgate scan` when you want the manifest's
full packet renderer set (`packet.md`, `packet.html`, or `packet.pdf`).

`agents-shipgate verify --preview --json` is a lightweight relevance check: it
runs no scan, requires no manifest, exits 0, and emits a `verifier.json` with
`mode: "preview"`, `execution: "not_run"`,
`applicability: "not_evaluated"`, and
`control.state: "agent_action_required"`; `control.next_action` carries the
next recommended action. The handoff uses `operation: "verify_preview"` and no
release decision. That action may be `detect`/`initialize` for
relevant unconfigured repos, or `verify` for configured repos. Use it as the
first touch on a repo or PR before committing to a full scan.

`verifier.json` is governed by [`docs/verifier-schema.v0.16.json`](docs/verifier-schema.v0.16.json).
Verifier v0.1 through v0.15 remain frozen references — a published schema
identifier never gains an emitted field, so `0.9` carries
`capability_review.policy_weakening_proven` and `0.8` keeps the bytes every
consumer pinned to it already validates against. Artifacts declaring `0.8`
and earlier still read: the field defaults to `false`, which is exactly what
"this artifact recorded no base-vs-head comparison" means. It remains an orchestration artifact: `release_decision.decision` in
`report.json` is still the only release gate. Release and merge fields remain
mirrors or deterministic projections of report data; the v0.6 authorization
evaluation and the v0.7 `diff_status` block are operational overlays that
cannot change them. Stable additive
fields a consumer may read:

- `control` — the schema-enforced `complete | agent_action_required |
  review_publishable |
  human_review_required` operational projection. The same serialized object is
  emitted by verifier, handoff, and verify-run.
- `execution` — `"not_run" | "succeeded" | "skipped" | "failed"`.
- `diff_status` (v0.7+) — how completely the compared change set was read, and
  why not when it was not. `completeness` is `"complete" | "partial" |
  "unavailable"`; `reason` is `null` exactly when `completeness` is
  `"complete"`, and otherwise one of `not_attempted`, `refs_missing`,
  `merge_base_missing`, `unrelated_histories`, `objects_missing`,
  `metadata_limit_exceeded`, `body_limit_exceeded`, `git_timeout`,
  `git_failed`. `merge_base_missing` and `unrelated_histories` are
  deliberately distinct: the first is a shallow checkout that truncated a
  merge base which does exist, and deepening restores it; the second is two
  roots with no common ancestor, which no fetch can create — `fetch_repairable`
  is the field to branch on. `detail` is a bounded, path-redacted excerpt of
  Git's own diagnostic; `remediation` names the repair; `fetch_repairable`
  says whether making refs or objects available locally can fix it.
  **`"complete"` is the only value that licenses reading a negative `trigger`
  result.** Anything else means the evidence the verdict would rest on was
  missing — it is never evidence that a PR is unrelated to agent capabilities.
  `null` means the artifact predates v0.7 and carries no input-health
  evidence, which a consumer must treat as unknown, never as complete. New
  `reason` values may be added additively; treat an unrecognized reason as
  "the diff was not read in full".
- `static_analysis_only`, `runtime_behavior_verified`, and
  `static_verdict_disclaimer` — locked to `true`, `false`, and the canonical
  static-only disclaimer. When an embedded release decision is present, the
  verifier model rejects any disagreement.
- `merge_verdict` — `mergeable` / `human_review_required` /
  `insufficient_evidence` / `blocked` / `unknown`. A deterministic projection of
  `release_decision.decision` (`passed`→`mergeable`,
  `review_required`→`human_review_required`,
  `insufficient_evidence`→`insufficient_evidence`, `blocked`→`blocked`, missing
  decision→`unknown`). It cannot disagree with the gate. Switch on the enum with
  an `unknown`/`human_review_required` fallback for unrecognized future values.
- `applicability` — `"not_evaluated"` / `"verified"` /
  `"not_applicable"` / `"failed"`; whether
  Shipgate evaluated the change. Disambiguates a `mergeable` verdict
  (`"not_applicable"` means the head scan was skipped — *not* "verified safe").
  Locked to `"verified"` whenever a `release_decision` is present.
- `can_merge_without_human` — `bool`; whether the PR can merge without human
  review.
- `decision` — mirror of `release_decision.decision` (or `null` when no scan
  ran).
- `headline` — single-sentence, PR-comment-friendly summary (or `null`).
- `authorization` — the
  `shipgate.human_authorization_evaluation/v1` result. `accepted` is possible
  only for a successful `review_required` evaluation and must carry the same
  one exact command as `control.next_action` and
  `control.allowed_next_commands`. `not_requested`, `not_applicable`, and
  `rejected` carry no command authority; rejection reason codes are evidence,
  never instructions.
- `human_review` and `first_next_action` — compatibility mirrors of
  `control.human_review` and `control.next_action` for one cycle.
- `trust_root_touched` — `bool`; `true` when the PR changed a release-gate trust
  root (`shipgate.yaml`, the Shipgate CI workflow, `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`,
  policy packs, prompts, baselines, waivers, and the other surfaces listed under
  the trust-root protection design). Backed by the deterministic
  `SHIP-VERIFY-TRUST-ROOT-TOUCHED` check, whose findings flow through the normal
  decision engine.
- `capability_review` — deterministic reviewer-facing projection of
  `capability_change`, with `{trust_root_touched, policy_weakened,
  policy_weakening_proven, capability_changes_added, capability_changes_removed,
  capability_changes_modified, top_changes[]}`. `policy_weakened` is the
  fail-closed routing flag — raised whenever the release policy may have gotten
  weaker, including when no base policy existed to compare against;
  `policy_weakening_proven` (added `0.16`, default `false`) is the narrower
  fact that a base-vs-head comparison actually ran and found the head weaker.
  It is never `true` without `policy_weakened`. Gate on the former; say the
  policy was weakened only on the latter. `top_changes[]` carries the
  highest-signal capability deltas with `{id, title, impact, rationale,
  related_finding_ids}`. `impact` mirrors the gate; this block never introduces a
  finding-independent blocker. Treat it as supporting/provisional reviewer
  context, not as the controller's primary verdict.
- `mode` — `"advisory"` / `"strict"` / `"skipped"` / `"preview"`.

`verifier.json` also carries `trigger` — the run/skip evaluation, catalog
schema `0.3`. Read `trigger.evaluation_status` before `trigger.should_run`:
when it is `"not_evaluated"`, `should_run`, `run_shipgate`, `skip`, and
`skip_reason` are all `null` because the diff was not read in full (see
`diff_status`), and `next_action.kind` is `"input_required"`. `skip_reason` is
one of `stop_conditions`, `skip_rule`, `dry_run_only`, `no_match` — and
`no_match` is never emitted for inputs that were not fully read. A `run`
verdict *is* still published from partial evidence: rule matching is monotone,
so more evidence can only add matches. `matched_rules` says what carried it —
a `force_run` match rests on the manifest being present, not on anything the
diff showed. It also carries `base_status`,
`head_status`, `base_ref`, `head_ref`, `changed_files`, `base_notes`, the full
embedded `release_decision`, and an `artifacts` map
(`{verifier_json, pr_comment, report_json, report_markdown, report_sarif,
packet_json}`). The corresponding GitHub Action outputs are `merge_verdict`,
`can_merge_without_human`, `agent_control_state`, `agent_control_reason`,
`trust_root_touched`, and
`capability_changes_{added,modified,removed}`; the original `decision`,
`blocker_count`, `review_item_count`, `ci_would_fail`, and legacy control
boolean outputs are preserved as exact derived mirrors for one cycle.

Successful base reports are cached under git metadata
(`git rev-parse --git-path agents-shipgate/base-scans/...`), not under the
working tree or report output directory. The cache is a local-iteration
optimization, safe to miss on ephemeral CI, and verify prunes stale entries
best-effort after writes.

### Verify Check IDs

New stable check IDs (v0.22+, category `verify` — trust-root protection
for AI coding workflows). All emit **only** when a `VerificationContext`
is present (`scan --changed-files …` or the `verify` command); a plain
`scan` emits nothing. Like `SHIP-VERIFY-TRUST-ROOT-TOUCHED` (v0.21), they
are category `verify`, so they bypass `checks.ignore` suppression and
declare a `floor_severity` (a manifest override below the floor is a
config error, exit 2). They are ordinary `Finding`s routed through
`release_decision` — never a second verdict.

- `SHIP-VERIFY-POLICY-WEAKENED` (high, floor high) — base-vs-head normalized
  effective policy weakened: CI mode downgraded, fail-on severity set
  loosened, or a severity override lowered across a tier. The claim is
  base-relative, so it fires only when a base snapshot exists to compare
  against.
- `SHIP-VERIFY-POLICY-BASE-ABSENT` (medium, floor medium, added `0.16`) — the
  fail-safe for the missing base. A policy/manifest trust root was touched and
  no base effective-policy snapshot was available, so no weakening claim can
  be made in either direction; the change routes to human review rather than
  passing silently. Two evidence kinds: `manifest_introduced` (git proves the
  base carries no manifest at all — a first adoption, and the only case that
  reports `verifier_summary.policy_weakened: false`) and
  `base_snapshot_unavailable` (no base report was obtainable; the direction is
  unprovable, so `policy_weakened` stays raised). Before `0.16` both kinds
  emitted under `SHIP-VERIFY-POLICY-WEAKENED`; that id keeps firing for every
  proven base-relative weakening and is not deprecated. Severity, category,
  the `human_ack` requirement on the `policy` surface, `protected_surface_changes`
  rows, and the resulting release decision are unchanged by the split, and
  three compatibility rules keep it that way:

  - **Configuration written against the pre-split id still reaches this
    check.** `checks.severity_overrides` (and any other configured match) for
    `SHIP-VERIFY-POLICY-WEAKENED` applies to `SHIP-VERIFY-POLICY-BASE-ABSENT`
    as well, so a repository that had raised the no-base fail-safe to
    `critical` still gets `critical` and still blocks. An override written
    against the new id wins over the umbrella. Floor validation is unchanged:
    an override against `SHIP-VERIFY-POLICY-WEAKENED` is still checked against
    its own `high` floor.
  - **Reports written before the split still reproject to what they meant.**
    Every read path (`verifier_summary.policy_weakened`, `capability_review`,
    `protected_surface_changes`, `human_ack`, the adoption fix-task route, and
    the Action's findings fallback) accepts either id with the same evidence
    kinds. Nothing re-emits the old id for a no-base run.
  - **Fail-closed routing and the human-facing claim are separate.**
    `policy_weakened` stays raised whenever the direction could not be
    established; the new `capability_review.policy_weakening_proven` is the
    narrower fact that a base-vs-head comparison actually ran and found the
    head weaker. Copy is selected from the narrower one, so an unprovable
    direction is never reported as a proven weakening while the conservative
    route is preserved.
- `SHIP-VERIFY-BASELINE-OR-WAIVER-EXPANDED` (high, floor high) — a new
  suppression, a widened waiver scope, or a larger accepted-debt baseline
  versus the base report.
- `SHIP-VERIFY-CI-GATE-REMOVED` (critical, floor high) — a Shipgate CI
  workflow path is in the changed files and no longer exists on disk (the PR
  deleted the gate).
- `SHIP-VERIFY-AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS-WEAKENED` (medium, floor medium) —
  **deprecated in the unreleased minor cycle (#516)**. New scans emit no
  findings for this ID. It remains registered with the same metadata for
  historical reports, configured overrides and suppressions, for at least one
  minor-version cycle after the deprecation ships. It is not repurposed as a
  structural check. Existing structured host readers, the skill-command mention heuristic and
  generic trust-root protection remain active; #545 owns the remaining prose-only
  routing boundary. No release decision enum or severity changes.
- `SHIP-VERIFY-TRIGGER-CATALOG-DRIFT` (medium, floor medium) — the trigger
  catalog that decides when Shipgate runs changed; routed to human review to
  rule out gate evasion.

### Tool-Surface Diff

`agents-shipgate scan --diff-from <path>` accepts a prior `report.json` or a
v0.4 baseline JSON with `tool_surface_facts` and `action_surface_facts`. If both `--baseline` and
`--diff-from` are provided, `--baseline` continues to drive finding baseline
status, strict-mode filtering, and `release_decision.baseline_delta`;
`--diff-from` drives `tool_surface_diff` and `action_surface_diff`.

If `--diff-from` is absent and `--baseline` points at a v0.4 baseline with
surface facts, the baseline snapshot is used as the diff reference. v0.3
baselines can still enable `tool_surface_diff` but not `action_surface_diff`.
Older v0.2 baselines still load for accepted-debt gating, but they cannot
enable either surface diff and emit disabled diff notes instead.

The diff is static evidence only. It does not fetch branches in the CLI,
infer runtime routing, or execute tools. Action Surface Diff policy findings
can affect release gating through `findings[].blocks_release`; Tool Surface
Diff remains explanatory only.

### Release Evidence Packet (v0.18)

`agents-shipgate-reports/packet.json` is a supporting/provisional reviewer
artifact governed by [`docs/packet-schema.v0.18.json`](docs/packet-schema.v0.18.json).
v0.12 adds request, subject, input-set, engine-requirement, and decision IDs
while preserving the report release decision as the only gate. v0.11 and
earlier packets validate against their matching frozen schemas. v0.11 added
typed policy support; v0.9 added provider-scoped tool identities; v0.8 added
report v0.29 semantic
coverage and evidence-gap remediation; v0.7 added capability-linked
local trace evidence under `human_in_the_loop`; v0.6 added the top-level
`evidence_matrix` section and the
optional `ReleaseDecisionItem.source` and `ReleaseDecisionItem.policy_evidence_source`
pointers for reviewer-grade dual-source provenance on top of v0.5. Within `0.x`:

- `packet_schema_version` is a real field on every emitted packet; minor bumps are additive.
- `release_decision.{static_analysis_only,runtime_behavior_verified,static_verdict_disclaimer}` mirrors the report release decision exactly; current emitted values are `true`, `false`, and the canonical static-verdict disclaimer.
- The reviewer sections (release_decision, evidence_matrix, capability_intent, high_risk_surface, tool_surface_diff, action_surface_diff, approval_coverage, idempotency_risk, scope_coverage, memory_isolation, human_in_the_loop, dynamic_scenarios, not_proven) are always present.
- `evidence_matrix.rows[]` is a compact, packet-only review summary derived from public `report.json` fields. It never contributes to `release_decision`, CI exit behavior, severity, suppression, baseline matching, or `agent_summary`; its blocker and review-item references are copied from `release_decision`.
- The 13 `evidence_matrix.rows[].domain` identities are stable within `0.x`. Adding source paths or check mappings is additive; removing a row, renaming a domain, or dropping an existing check/source mapping requires a packet schema bump.
- `human_in_the_loop.runtime_control_disclaimer` is always present and applies to covered and gap states: local HITL evidence is not runtime-enforcement proof.
- `human_in_the_loop.source_provenance[]` is deterministic, local-only provenance for validation evidence when available. Packets rebuilt from `report.json` may set `provenance_mode: "unavailable"` when no finding-level provenance survived.
- `human_in_the_loop.capability_trace_summary` and `human_in_the_loop.capability_trace_refs` are deterministic audit metadata for declared local trace artifacts. They do not prove runtime enforcement and never contribute to the packet verdict.
- `release_decision.verdict` always derives from `release_decision.decision`. CI behavior (`fail_policy`) is rendered separately as metadata, never as the verdict.
- `not_proven.unconditional` always lists the four canonical disclaimers verbatim — prompt robustness, runtime behavior, model correctness, adversarial resistance.
- The packet is a local artifact (`agents-shipgate-reports/packet.{md,json,html}`, optionally `packet.pdf` with the `[pdf]` extras). There is no hosted/SaaS surface.

### Fixture names

Fixture names listed by `agents-shipgate fixture list` are stable. Names will not be renamed. New fixtures may be added.

`ai_generated_refund_pr` is the verify-native demo fixture. It creates a
temporary base/head git history and writes `verifier.json`, `verify-run.json`,
`agent-handoff.json`, `verification-receipt.json`, `report.json`, and
`pr-comment.md` for a blocked
refund-capability PR.

### Agent handoff artifact

`agents-shipgate-reports/agent-handoff.json` is the preferred compact
machine-readable handoff object for coding agents and CI agents. The current
schema is
[`docs/agent-handoff-schema.v8.json`](docs/agent-handoff-schema.v8.json) with
`schema_version: "shipgate.agent_handoff/v8"`. v1 through v7 remain frozen
references.

The handoff artifact is derived only from `verifier.json`, `verify-run.json`,
and `report.json`. It mirrors `release_decision.decision`,
`verifier.json.merge_verdict`, and
the byte-identical `verifier.json.control` object. Handoff v8 also mirrors the
verifier's `authorization` evaluation; it cannot upgrade or reinterpret it. Its
`gate.{static_analysis_only,runtime_behavior_verified,static_verdict_disclaimer}`
also mirrors the verifier/report boundary; construction fails if any mirror
disagrees. It never computes a separate release verdict, does not contain
LLM-generated prose, and does not replace
`report.json.release_decision.decision` as the release gate.

Use `agents-shipgate agent handoff --from agents-shipgate-reports/verifier.json
--report agents-shipgate-reports/report.json --verify-run
agents-shipgate-reports/verify-run.json --json` to re-render the same artifact
from existing local outputs. The command exits `0` when a valid handoff is
emitted, `3` for missing or invalid input artifacts, and `4` for internal
errors; it does not mirror the gate result.

### Feedback export

`agents-shipgate feedback export` derives a small local artifact from
`agents-shipgate-reports/verifier.json`. The current schema is
[`docs/feedback-schema.v0.1.json`](docs/feedback-schema.v0.1.json). Current
v0.1 fields:

- `feedback_schema_version`
- `source_verifier`
- `redacted`
- `merge_verdict`
- `can_merge_without_human`
- `decision`
- `mode`
- `trigger`
- `first_next_action`
- `fix_task`
- `capability_review`
- `finding_ids`
- `reviewer_feedback_requested`
- `artifacts`

The export is a design-partner and false-positive triage aid. It is derived
from verifier projections and does not include raw finding evidence. With
`--redact` (the default), local artifact paths are reduced to filenames so the
artifact does not leak usernames or confidential workspace directory names.

### Attestation

`agents-shipgate attest` derives a deterministic, local attestation from
`agents-shipgate-reports/verifier.json` (enriched from the sibling `report.json`
when present). The current schema is
[`docs/attestation-schema.v0.5.json`](docs/attestation-schema.v0.5.json). It
records the verdict, the report-derived capability delta, optional local
organization/CI context, detailed declared `human_ack` entries, a
policy-snapshot hash, content hashes of the verify artifacts, and capability
lock/diff hash bindings and the terminal receipt graph when verify emitted
those artifacts. It carries no
wall-clock timestamp — it is content-addressed by git SHAs and artifact hashes,
so re-deriving from the same inputs is byte-identical. It does not gate;
`release_decision.decision` remains the only gate. Current v0.5 fields:

`org bundle` accepts previously generated attestation files through the frozen
reader path. The emitted bundle projects a current v0.5 attestation and binds
the same request, receipt, decision, and artifact-set IDs.

With `--redact` (the default), `source_verifier`, capability lock/diff paths,
and artifact paths are reduced to filenames. Redaction does not remove explicit
organization/CI identity fields (`org.repo`, `org.actor`, `org.merge_sha`,
`org.workflow_run_id`, etc.); omit the corresponding flags or CI context when
those identities should not be recorded.

- `attestation_schema_version`
- `cli_version`
- `org` (`org_id`, `repo`, `service`, `tier`, `pr_number`, `workflow_run_id`, `actor`, `merge_sha`)
- `source_verifier`
- `redacted`
- `run_id`, `verify_run_sha256`
- `event_time`, `source_url`, `branch`, `base_sha`, `head_sha`
- `base_ref`, `head_ref`, `base_tree_sha`, `head_tree_sha`, `mode`
- `verdict` (`merge_verdict`, `decision`, `applicability`, `can_merge_without_human`)
- `capability` (`added`, `modified`, `removed`, `trust_root_touched`, `policy_weakened`, `change_ids`)
- `capability_lock` (`path`, `sha256`, `capability_lock_schema_version`, `semantic_capability_set_hash`, `evidence_set_hash`, `source_set_hash`, `capability_count`)
- `capability_diff` (`path`, `sha256`, `capability_lock_diff_schema_version`, base/head semantic hashes, `summary`) or `null`
- `human_ack` (`required`, `satisfied`, `outstanding`, `acks`)
- `policy_snapshot_sha256`
- `policy_packs[]` (`id`, `name`, `version`, `path`, `sha256`, `status`, `rule_count`)
- `artifact_sha256`

### Capability Lock And Diff

`agents-shipgate capability export` writes a stable local static capability
envelope to `.agents-shipgate/capabilities.lock.json` and, by default, a
byte-identical generated mirror at
`agents-shipgate-reports/capabilities.lock.json`. The current lock schema is
[`docs/capability-lock-schema.v0.8.json`](docs/capability-lock-schema.v0.8.json)
and emitted locks carry `capability_lock_schema_version: "0.8"` plus
`experimental: false`. Prior schemas stay frozen; a lock declaring `0.6` or
`0.7` is advanced to `0.8` on read, so nothing needs regenerating.

`agents-shipgate capability diff` compares two lockfiles and emits added,
removed, `reidentified`, semantic `changed`, and `evidence_changed` rows. The
current diff schema is
[`docs/capability-lock-diff-schema.v0.9.json`](docs/capability-lock-diff-schema.v0.9.json)
and emitted diffs carry `capability_lock_diff_schema_version: "0.9"` plus
`experimental: false`. `reidentified` is the scope/resource case: scope is part
of capability identity, so a scope escalation changes the id and is paired by
agent/provider/operation/tool identity instead of being reported as unrelated add/remove
churn.

The lock is an enumerable-tools envelope. Dynamic toolkit scope bounds are
disclosed by `source.toolkit_bound_count` but are not emitted as capability facts
yet. `cli_version` is provenance and may change on scanner upgrades; it is not
part of the semantic capability-set hash. Runtime trace evidence, findings, and
gate verdicts are intentionally excluded from capability locks and semantic lock
hashes.

Capability lock/diff artifacts are deterministic and carry no wall-clock
timestamp. They are stable non-gating artifacts for external integrations and
research; they are not emitted in `report.json` and do not gate.
`release_decision.decision` remains the only gate. Capability standard v0.2
adds each fact's optional normalized `semantic_assessment`; newly emitted v0.3
locks populate it. The v0.2 lock and v0.3 diff schemas remain frozen references
for archived artifacts. Legacy experimental
`capability_lock_schema_version: "0.1"` lock files remain readable by
`agents-shipgate capability diff`; the old combined schema remains a frozen
reference at
[`docs/capability-lock-schema.v0.1.json`](docs/capability-lock-schema.v0.1.json).
The public standard is documented in
[`docs/capability-standard.md`](docs/capability-standard.md).

`agents-shipgate verify` also writes the head static lock to
`agents-shipgate-reports/capabilities.lock.json` after a successful head scan.
When `--base` is provided and the base scan can be materialized, verify writes
`agents-shipgate-reports/base.capabilities.lock.json`,
`agents-shipgate-reports/capability-lock-diff.json`, and
`agents-shipgate-reports/capability-lock-diff.md`, and the PR comment includes a
compact semantic capability diff summary. If the base scan-derived lock is
unavailable, verify falls back to the reviewed committed lock at
`.agents-shipgate/capabilities.lock.json`; if both are unavailable, it records a
note and falls back to the existing `capability_review.top_changes[]` projection
without changing the release gate.

### Capability Payload (`shipgate.capability_payload/v1`)

`shipgate.capability_payload/v1` is the **frozen shared payload** of two planned
surfaces: the exported capability delta published as a standalone attestation,
and the committed capability state. It is published now, ahead of either, so
both serialize one structure instead of two. The schema is
[`docs/capability-payload-schema.v1.json`](docs/capability-payload-schema.v1.json)
and the spec is
[`docs/capability-payload.md`](docs/capability-payload.md).

**Nothing emits it yet.** No command writes it, no artifact carries it, and
`contract_version`, `report_schema_version`, the runtime contract JSON, and
`.well-known/agents-shipgate.json` are all unchanged by its publication. The
capability lock and lock diff above are unchanged. It is non-gating;
`release_decision.decision` remains the only gate.

**Validation is two stages, and the schema file is stage one.** Pydantic
cross-field rules do not appear in a generated JSON Schema, so every rule that
needs a *recomputation* is unexpressible there. Everything JSON Schema can
express has been pushed into the published file — required keys, closed enums,
the `view` discriminator, key/id/digest patterns, safe-range integers, strict
scalar types, non-empty and unique lists, the transition/sides/direction
coupling, the presence/transition coupling including which changes each side may
carry, and the permission shapes the classifier can produce. The rest is stage
two, enumerated in the spec page and in the schema's own `description`. A
consumer that runs only stage one does not have the guarantees below.

**The reference parser accepts exactly the schema's language.**
`CapabilityPayloadV1` uses strict scalars, so it does not coerce `"2"` to an
integer or `"false"` to a boolean where the published schema would refuse them.

What a consumer may rely on:

- One document, two views, discriminated on `view` (`state` | `delta`), both
  validated by the one schema file.
- **Every field of every object is required** — in the schema's `required`
  arrays, not merely in prose. A version field or a discriminator a consumer may
  omit and have repaired is not one. Fields are nullable where the evidence may
  not exist; null means "not stated", never "false".
- `subject.key` identifies a row, is unique across `subjects[]`, and is
  **recomputed from the row's own identity** on parse:
  `"capsubj_" + sha256(canonical_json({agent, provider, tool_id}))[:16]`, not
  from the subject kind. Two rows cannot split one logical tool between them.
- **Canonical bytes are fully specified**, because the format is for consumers
  that are not this program: UTF-8 and never escaped, object keys sorted, no
  insignificant whitespace, integers only inside the I-JSON safe range
  (`|n| ≤ 9007199254740991`), no non-finite numbers, and no fallback
  serialization. Every object key is ASCII — enforced, not assumed:
  `capability_id` is the one dynamic key and is constrained to
  `^cap_[0-9a-f]{16}$`, because Python orders keys by code point and RFC 8785 by
  UTF-16 code unit and the two disagree above the BMP. Within those constraints
  this agrees with RFC 8785, and the spec page publishes cross-language vectors.
- `summary`, each `subjects[].transition`, each `changed_dimensions`, each
  `semantic_direction` and `semantic_changes`, and a `state`'s three digests are
  **recomputed on parse**. A payload that disagrees with its own rows is
  rejected, not corrected. In particular `semantic_direction` is *derived from
  the two carried records* — it is the direction of what this payload publishes,
  not a producer's assertion — and `evidence_only` means exactly "the two
  records are equal apart from provenance".
- The two state refs are bound to the membership rows:
  `head.subject_count - base.subject_count` equals added minus removed subjects,
  and the same equation holds for capability counts over `added` / `removed`
  record transitions.
- `transition` is a statement about the subject's presence, carried as
  `present_in_base` / `present_in_head`, not about the kinds of its changes: a
  tool that keeps one operation and loses another is `modified`, because it is
  still there. Presence also bounds the changes — a subject absent from base can
  only carry `added` ones.
- A change entry cannot contradict its records: `changed` requires the same
  `capability_id` and `identity_hash` on both sides and `reidentified` requires
  different ones; `changed_dimensions` must be exactly the digests that differ;
  a membership change carries the matching direction and no dimensions; and
  `evidence_only` requires the two published records to be semantically equal —
  so a published permission expansion can never be labelled provenance-only.
- `permission` publishes the lattice's semantic half from the same classifier as
  `mcp audit`, in a shape the classifier can actually produce (`read` never
  pairs with a side-effecting class, `destructive` always carries `write`,
  unknown side effects always carry `unknown`). An unmeasured profile is
  `unavailable` with side effects unknown — never read-only.
- `capabilities[].capability_id` is the internal `CapabilityFactV1.id`
  verbatim, and is unique across the whole payload — provenance is keyed by it.
- `analysis_coverage` names the subjects the analysed surface left out. A
  `state` carries one coverage block; a **`delta` carries both sides** plus the
  recomputed `newly_outside_analysis` / `no_longer_outside_analysis`, because
  one snapshot cannot tell a newly added unbound tool from one that was already
  unbound — and only the first is something a reviewer of that diff must act on.
  `status` is `not_requested | unavailable | complete`, **neither of the first
  two means zero**, only `complete` may name subjects, and a comparison is only
  as established as its weaker side. The lists are deliberately not disjoint
  from `subjects[]`: a tool that lost its binding belongs to both.
- A state publishes three digests over its own published content —
  `capability_set_digest` (semantics), `evidence_set_digest` (provenance,
  including each record's `evidence_hash`), and `analysis_coverage_digest`.
  Together they bind everything the state publishes, so two payloads with
  matching refs are the same published state. A `state` verifies its own three
  on parse; a `delta`'s `base`/`head` refs name states it does not carry, so
  those are taken on trust — except each side's coverage digest, which the delta
  does carry and does check.
- A `delta` with no subject rows must name two states whose **capability and
  evidence** digests agree and whose counts are equal. `analysis_coverage_digest`
  is deliberately excluded: a change that only moves what could not be analysed
  has no subject rows by construction, and that coverage-only delta must stay
  expressible.
- No wall clock. Two projections of the same static inputs are byte-identical,
  in any process — permission class ordering is total, so nothing inherits
  hash-randomized set iteration.
- Every model forbids unknown properties. The fields the payload deliberately
  does not publish, and the reason for each, are listed in the spec page and in
  `agents_shipgate.core.capability_payload`.

**Evolution: `v1` is closed, and that is the whole policy.** This departs from
the additive-within-a-version rule the `report.json` schema follows, because the
two schemas make opposite promises. `report.json` is open by construction and
its consumers ignore what they do not know. This payload is closed by
construction — `additionalProperties: false` everywhere, closed enums
everywhere — so a `v1` validator *rejects* a new optional field and a new enum
value rather than ignoring them, and promising additivity would be promising
something the shipped validators do not do. Therefore: any addition, removal, or
change of meaning is `/v2`, published as a new schema file beside this one; `v1`
stays committed and readable for at least one minor cycle after `v2` lands
(the deprecation rule applied to a whole version, which is the unit here); and a
producer migrates by emitting both for a cycle rather than bending `v1`.

### Workflow-evidence capture

`agents-shipgate feedback capture` records a deterministic, local, replayable
*scenario* from a verify before/after pair — one real pilot loop turned into
benchmark fuel. The current schema is
[`docs/scenario-schema.v0.1.json`](docs/scenario-schema.v0.1.json). It does not
gate. With `--redact` (the default) it keeps only provenance (sha256, length,
diffstat) of the prompt / diff / transcript — never raw content — so it is safe
to share. Current v0.1 fields:

- `scenario_schema_version`
- `redacted`
- `prompt_class`
- `human_decision` (`merged` / `rejected` / `changes_requested` / `none` / null)
- `before` / `after` — per-side state (`merge_verdict`, `decision`,
  `applicability`, `can_merge_without_human`, `trust_root_touched`,
  `policy_weakened`, `capability`)
- `transition` — `verdict_before`, `verdict_after`, `resolved`,
  `introduced_trust_root_touch`, `introduced_policy_weakening`, and
  `suspected_gate_bypass` (`mergeable` while a trust-root touch or policy
  weakening is present — impossible for a valid verifier)
- `evidence` — `prompt` / `diff` / `transcript` provenance
- `source`

### Agent-skill paths

The following paths are part of the public agent surface and will not move within `0.x`:

- [`prompts/`](prompts/) — task-shaped recipes, individual filenames are stable
- [`.claude/commands/shipgate.md`](.claude/commands/shipgate.md) — Claude Code `/shipgate` slash command
- [`skills/agents-shipgate/SKILL.md`](skills/agents-shipgate/SKILL.md) — Claude Code skill. Frontmatter `name` is fixed at `agents-shipgate` (deliberately distinct from the `/shipgate` command so the skill cannot preempt it). Trigger phrases in `description` may broaden additively but will not narrow.
- [`skills/agents-shipgate/prompts/`](skills/agents-shipgate/prompts/) and [`skills/agents-shipgate/ci-recipes/`](skills/agents-shipgate/ci-recipes/) — bundled supporting files the skill references via relative paths. Filenames listed in `SKILL.md` are stable.

The body content of these files may change to reflect new prompts; the entry-point paths will not.

`agents-shipgate skill lint`, `agents-shipgate skill security`, and
`agents-shipgate skill review` are supporting/provisional review helpers in
`0.x`. They may inform skill and instruction review, but they are not the CI
release gate and should not be treated as a substitute for
`report.json.release_decision.decision`.

---

## What MAY change additively in any minor release

These are not stable — assume they may grow but not shrink:

- **Risk-tag taxonomy.** New tags may appear (e.g. `infrastructure_change`, `code_execution`). Existing tags' meanings will not change.
- **`capability_facts[].capability` vocabulary.** Values are an open vocabulary seeded from risk tags plus review sentinels such as `wildcard_tool_surface` and `unknown`.
- **Report `frameworks.{name}` blocks.** New framework summaries (e.g. `frameworks.langchain`) may appear, and new count keys may be added to an existing summary (e.g. `frameworks.google_adk.tool_binding_count`). Tool counts such as `function_tool_count` count tool *definitions*: one tool bound to three agents is one tool and three bindings, and only the binding count moves with the wiring.
- **Manifest fields.** New optional fields under existing sections.
- **Check default severities.** May tighten over time. To pin a severity for your repo, use `checks.severity_overrides`.
- **`release_decision.decision` enum values.** New states (e.g., `insufficient_evidence` added at `report_schema_version` 0.14) may be added. Consumers that switch on the enum MUST fall back to `review_required` for unrecognized values — that is the safe default. Existing values' meanings will not change. New states do not change CI exit codes (exit 20 still requires a `fail_on` match on actual findings).
- **`agent_summary.verdict` enum values.** Mirror `release_decision.decision`; same additivity and fallback rule.
- **`reviewer_summary.verdict` enum values.** Mirror `release_decision.decision` and `agent_summary.verdict`; same additivity and fallback rule. The three enums move in lockstep — adding a value to one without the others is a contract violation.
- **`reviewer_summary.first_recommended_surface.{kind, name}` enum values.** New surface kinds and names may be added (e.g., when a sixth reviewer lens or fourth audit envelope ships). Consumers that switch on `name` MUST fall back to "ignore the pointer and read every documented surface" for unrecognized values. The priority order between surfaces may also be revised additively when a new surface is added — the contract is the deterministic projection, not the specific ranking.
- **`verifier_summary.verdict` enum values** (v0.22+). Mirrors `release_decision.decision`; same additivity and fallback rule. It joins `agent_summary.verdict` and `reviewer_summary.verdict` in the lockstep set — adding a value to one without the others is a contract violation.
- **`capability_change` member enum values** (v0.22+; semantic direction v0.23+): `direction` (`added | removed | broadened | narrowed`), `semantic_direction` (`added | removed | broadened | narrowed | mixed | unknown | evidence_only`), `subject_kind` (`tool | action | scope | policy | ci | baseline | agent_instruction | manifest | unknown`), and `release_impact` (`none | informational | review_required | blocks_release | insufficient_evidence`). New values may be added additively; consumers that switch on them MUST fall back to a conservative default (treat unknown `release_impact` as `review_required`, unknown `subject_kind` as `unknown`, unknown `semantic_direction` as `unknown`).
- **`protected_surface_changes[].kind`** (v0.22+) — the trust-root surface bucket (e.g. `manifest`, `policy`, `ci_gate`, `agent_instructions`, `trigger_catalog`). New buckets may be added as new trust-root classes ship; treat unknown kinds as "a protected surface was touched — review it".

---

## What MAY change in any minor release

These are explicitly NOT part of the public contract:

- **Internal module layout** under `src/agents_shipgate/`. Importing from non-public modules will break.
- **Legacy internal schema imports** such as `agents_shipgate.core.models`,
  `agents_shipgate.config.schema`, `agents_shipgate.core.patches`, and
  `agents_shipgate.packet.models`. Public wire-contract models live under
  `agents_shipgate.schemas.*`; internal scan/domain containers live under
  `agents_shipgate.core.*` and are not a stable consumer API.
- **Markdown report layout.** Section ordering, exact wording, and table format may change. Parse the JSON report instead.
- **Risk classifier keyword sets** in `core/risk_hints.py`. False positives are tuned over time. To pin specific behavior, use `risk_overrides.tools.{tool}.{tags,remove_tags}` in your manifest.
- **Default `init` template.** The starter manifest format may grow new sections.
- **`CheckMetadata.evidence_fields`** content. New keys may be added to a check's evidence dict.

If you need stability guarantees beyond what's listed here, please open an issue describing the use case.

---

## Versioning

We follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) loosely:

- **Patch** (`x.y.Z`): bug fixes only. No new features, no breaking changes.
- **Minor** (`x.Y.0`): new features (new checks, new input loaders, new flags). Adheres to this contract.
- **Major** (`X.0.0`): may break the contract. Will be announced with a migration guide.

Artifact schemas version independently of the package. `report_schema_version`
is frozen at `1.0` and follows the `1.x` rules above; a deprecation cycle is
counted in shipped releases, never in elapsed time on unreleased `main`.

The current version is in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml). Changelog is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Reporting a contract violation

If you encounter behavior that contradicts this document — for example, an unsuppressed finding for a deprecated check ID, or a stable JSON field that disappeared — please [open an issue](https://github.com/ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate/issues/new) with:

1. The version of `agents-shipgate` (`agents-shipgate --version`)
2. The expected behavior per this document
3. The observed behavior (output, error message, JSON fragment)

Stability bugs are prioritized.

### Manifest-free host review (contract v35, #684)

Verifier schema `0.18` adds `host_comparison`: advisory rows from the existing
host inventory comparator, the compared commits and captured workspace identity,
inventory digests, source paths, and explicit comparison health. It never supplies
an application `release_decision`, a successful release receipt, or merge authority.
A missing or malformed manifest does not become an invented policy: existing
manifest routes remain governed by the verifier, and explicit strict/application
policy inputs retain their existing failure behavior when no manifest exists.
The published `0.17` schema remains frozen; reading an older verifier does not
invent host evidence.

Boundary result `shipgate.agent_boundary_result/v3` adds `rows`,
`comparison_status`, `incomparable_reasons`, and `comparison_scope`. Existing
local boundary policy decisions remain authoritative. Supplied diffs compare
only their changed host files; unresolved content is incomparable, not an empty
successful comparison. `check` continues to hide permission arguments, including
in its new rows; use the named source file for the exact rule. The older v2
schema and deprecated Codex v2 projection remain frozen.

Interactive `check` now defaults to text; detected agent mode defaults to the
current boundary JSON. Automation should always select `--format
agent-boundary-json` or `--format agent-control-json` explicitly. These existing
explicit formats are retained, and `--format text` is available in either mode.

### MCP URL capability digest (#723)

A URL-based MCP server's query parameters now enter its `config_sha256`, and
its file's `redacted_sha256`. A change carried in the query now produces a row:
removing `read_only=true`, adding `features=`, or pointing at a different
project. Before this change only the redacted URL was hashed, so none of these
was visible.

The URL path stays out of the digest. A webhook-style path is itself a secret,
and rotating one must stay quiet, so a capability carried only in the path
(`/read` → `/admin`) is still not seen.

Published fields are unchanged. `endpoint` still replaces the path with
`<redacted-path>` and drops the query, and nothing in the inventory, baseline
or rows carries a path, query or secret. A secret-named query parameter
contributes its name to the digest, never its value, and `env` and `headers`
contribute nothing. A server with no URL query keeps its earlier digest.

A host-grants baseline saved by an earlier build reports each URL server that
has a query as `changed` once, because its digest now covers more.
Review that row, then re-save the baseline. No schema version moves: the
digest's inputs changed, not the inventory's shape.

### Unchanged comparison limits (contract v37, #721)

Verifier schema `0.19` adds `host_comparison.unchanged_limits`, a list of
`{host, limit, source, detail}`. `limit` is `unsupported`, `parse_failed` or
`experimental_coverage`. It is non-empty only on a `comparable` comparison, and
an `incomparable` one names none.

A comparison used to refuse whenever either inventory was partial or
experimental, even when the surface that made it so was untouched. A limit is
now named instead of refusing when all three hold:

- it is present with the same kind, host and source on both sides;
- it is a per-source `unsupported` or `parse_failed` issue, or experimental host
  coverage;
- its source is byte-identical at base and head, by Git object ID for a commit
  and by unfiltered hash for a working tree.

Anything else still refuses, including an `unreadable` source. An unchanged
symlink whose in-tree target changed must not read as unchanged (#700).

`shipgate diff --json` moves to capability diff `0.2` with the same
`unchanged_limits` list. Its incomparable reason for an incomplete head is now
`head_inventory_incomplete`, matching `verify`.

`check --format agent-boundary-json` is unchanged:
`shipgate.agent_boundary_result/v3` has no field for a limit. Where `diff` and
`verify` would compare past one, `check` reports
`incomparable` / `unchanged_limits_not_representable`.

A `0.18` verifier artifact reads as `0.19` with no limits, which is what that
build knew. One that claims `unchanged_limits` is refused. The published `0.18`
schema stays frozen. `audit --host --save-baseline` still refuses an incomplete
inventory.
