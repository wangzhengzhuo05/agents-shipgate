"""Trust-model structural invariant: scanner does not execute or import user code.

This test enforces the core trust property of agents-shipgate at the source
level: every Python file under ``src/agents_shipgate/`` (not just
``inputs/``) must parse user files with ``ast.parse``, ``yaml.safe_load``,
or ``json.loads`` only — never through ``exec`` / ``eval`` / ``__import__``
/ ``compile`` builtins, and never via dynamic-import or process-execution
surfaces.

v0.18 (PR #2): the scope widened from adapter sources only to the whole
scanner package. A small allowlist (``ALLOWED_EXCEPTIONS`` below) captures
legitimate first-party meta-CLI surfaces with prose rationale — bootstrap
subprocess chaining, git probing in artifacts/triggers/verify, and
self-check ``__import__`` validation. Two contract tests prevent
allowlist rot.

What the scanner catches:

- Bare-name calls to ``exec`` / ``eval`` / ``__import__`` / ``compile``.
- Attribute calls to a fixed forbidden set
  (``importlib.import_module``, ``importlib.util.spec_from_file_location``,
  ``importlib.util.module_from_spec``, ``importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader``,
  ``runpy.run_path``, ``runpy.run_module``, ``subprocess.{run,call,Popen,
  check_call,check_output}``, ``os.system``, ``os.popen``).
- The full ``os.exec*`` / ``os.spawn*`` / ``os.posix_spawn*`` families
  via prefix matching, so a future Python addition like ``os.execlpe`` is
  caught without an enumeration update.
- Module imports from a forbidden set (``runpy``, ``subprocess``,
  ``importlib``, ``importlib.util``, ``importlib.machinery``, ``builtins``)
  — including ``import X as Y``, ``import X.child``, and
  ``from X.child import ...`` forms. Two explicit exceptions:
  ``importlib.metadata`` (reads installed-package metadata for plugin
  discovery) and ``importlib.resources`` (reads bundled-package files
  inside the agents-shipgate wheel) — neither reads user workspace code.
- **Aliased re-exports.** A two-pass walk first builds alias maps from
  ``import`` and ``from-import`` statements, then resolves attribute chains
  and bare-name calls back to their canonical dotted path before checking
  the forbidden sets. ``import os as oo; oo.system(...)``,
  ``from os import system as sh; sh(...)``, and
  ``from os import execve as runner; runner(...)`` all resolve to
  ``os.system`` / ``os.execve`` and are flagged.
- **Wildcard from-imports** from any tracked module
  (``from os import *``) — they would alias forbidden names into local
  scope and defeat the call-site checks.

What the scanner does NOT catch (acknowledged limitations):

- Flow-sensitive aliasing: ``ev = eval; ev("1+1")`` — no AST signal at the
  call site once the name is reassigned. Requires dataflow.
- Reflective access: ``getattr(os, "system")("ls")``,
  ``globals()["eval"]("...")``, ``__builtins__["eval"](...)``.
- ``import os.path`` followed by ``os.system(...)`` — caught (the top-level
  ``os`` binding is tracked) — but ``import os.path as p; p.path.system(...)``
  is not, because we don't follow attribute paths through aliased submodules.

These bypasses are flow-sensitive and require code review to catch. The lint
is the structural floor; code review is the dataflow ceiling.

Tests live in two layers:

1. **This file** (``test_adapter_static_only.py``) — AST scan of every
   ``src/agents_shipgate/**/*.py`` source (v0.18+; previously scoped to
   ``inputs/*.py`` only). Catches a regression *before* it ships and runs
   in CI in well under a second.
2. **``test_fixture_no_import.py``** — companion live-load tests that drive
   each adapter end-to-end against a fixture with a module-level
   ``raise RuntimeError(...)`` trap, then assert ``sys.modules`` is unchanged
   for the fixture directory.

The two layers together back the public claim in
`STABILITY.md` § *Trust-model invariants*.
