"""#410 §D — ``next_action.kind: confirm_declarations``.

The route is what turns a questionnaire into a loop an agent can finish. It
fires only where a declaration is what the verdict is short of, it authorizes
only publishing (never merge), and when it is done the remaining questions are
named rather than summarised as "human review required".

Everything here is asserted on the published envelope, because that is the
surface an agent actually reads.
